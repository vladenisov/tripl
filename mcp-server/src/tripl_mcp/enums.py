"""The closed value sets the tool schemas carry, mirrored from the API.

A tool parameter annotated ``str`` generates a JSON schema with no ``enum``, so
an agent choosing ``order_by="newest"`` learns it was wrong from a 422 the route
answers: a wasted round trip, and an error it has to parse instead of a value
its own tool schema would never have let it emit. Annotated as a ``Literal`` the
constraint reaches the schema — FastMCP builds the schema with Pydantic, which
renders a ``Literal`` as ``{"type": "string", "enum": [...]}`` and a
``list[Literal]`` as an array whose ``items`` carry the same — so the client
rejects the bad value locally, before any request (tripl-i0vd).

These are the same enums ``tripl_cli.api`` already mirrors for the CLI's
argparse ``choices=``, and they are spelled a second time here of necessity
rather than by preference: a ``Literal``'s members must be static, so
``Literal[*events.STATUSES]`` is not a type and no amount of importing avoids
the transcription. What CAN be avoided is trusting it. Every set below is held
to the same source of truth the CLI's copy is held to —
``tests/test_contract.py`` reads each one out of ``backend/openapi.json`` and
also asserts it against the CLI's tuple, so the two surfaces cannot end up
mirroring one route with two vocabularies.
