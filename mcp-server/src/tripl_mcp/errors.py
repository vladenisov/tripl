"""Re-attach tripl-mcp's own guidance to the shared client's typed failures.

The HTTP client moved into the `tripl` distribution (tripl-ey6j.1), which the
CLI also ships. It therefore cannot name this server's environment variables or
its Bearer-header convention — the CLI resolves --url/--api-key and a config
file, and a message telling a terminal user to "check the Bearer token sent to
this server" is nonsense. So the client raises structured, neutral errors and
this module puts the MCP-shaped wording back on, in the one place that knows it.

Applied at ``runtime._McpTriplClient``, i.e. once, rather than in each of the
six tools/ modules.
