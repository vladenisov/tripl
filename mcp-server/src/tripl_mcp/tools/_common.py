"""Shared helpers for tool implementations.

Everything here is a statement about THIS consumer: what a model should be made
to pay for, and what it should be told. That is why the four field projections
below stayed when tripl-i1dt revisited them — ``tripl events list``, ``plan
types``, ``plan fields`` and ``plan search`` all emit their rows VERBATIM, on
purpose (see ``tripl_cli.report.plan_read_document``), because a CLI writes to a
pipe and a trimmed row there is a field the operator has to fetch again. A
projection with one caller is a context-budget policy, not a fact about the API,
and moving one into ``tripl_cli`` would put agent payload policy in a
distribution with nothing to apply it to.

What DID move is the half of these bodies that was never about the consumer: the
``{items, total}`` envelope and ``semantic_used`` are what the routes answer, so
they are read through ``tripl_cli.api``. ``mcp-server/tests/test_contract.py``
pins that nothing here re-derives them.

    The server may rename an event to its scan-derived canonical name or flag

    Lives beside ``trim`` rather than in the HTTP client, where it used to sit:
    it never touches HTTP (the signature is ``(Any) -> Any`` over an already
    decoded body), its output is a PROMPT rather than data — "do not assume
    *your* proposed values were kept" is second-person address to a model — and
    it is the machinery implementing a rule written in prose three files away

    shared `tripl` client is consumed by a CLI too, which would print a warning
    line and exit 0, never an ``IMPORTANT_warnings`` dict key (tripl-ey6j.1).

    Re-checked when the CLI's read verbs landed and still has one caller
    (tripl-i1dt): ``tripl events`` is read-only BY DECISION — a catalog write has
    to land on a plan branch, and reproducing that gate from a shell is a command
    surface of its own (see ``tripl_cli.commands.events``). There is no second
    caller to share with until the CLI can write.
