"""The REST endpoints each MCP tool wraps.

Single source of truth for the contract test: every (method, path) here must
exist in ``backend/openapi.json``. The path LITERALS live in ``tripl_cli.api``,
which is where the tool bodies build their requests from too — so this map is a
statement about which tool touches what, and cannot drift from what the tool
actually sends (tripl-ey6j.5).

Kept separate from ``tripl_cli.diagnostics.endpoints`` on purpose: that one is
keyed by snapshot section, and this one's key set must equal the REGISTERED TOOL
NAMES, which ``test_every_registered_tool_has_a_contract_entry`` asserts. The
literal is shared; the declaration is not.
