# Pushing the tag triggers .github/workflows/release.yml, which (after CI passes)
# builds the multi-arch image and pushes it to GHCR (ghcr.io/<owner>/tripl)
# tagged X.Y.Z / X.Y / latest, then cuts a GitHub Release. See website/docs/run/release.md.

Usage: bin/release.sh [-n|--dry-run] [-y|--yes] <patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z>

Bumps the version in backend/pyproject.toml and frontend/package.json, commits,
creates an annotated git tag vX.Y.Z, and pushes branch + tag to origin.
The tag push triggers the release workflow (build + push image to GHCR).
