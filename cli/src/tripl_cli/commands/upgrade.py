"""``tripl upgrade --to X.Y.Z`` — the most dangerous thing this CLI does.

It moves a running stack to a new image tag, which applies Alembic migrations,
which are not reversible here. Everything below follows from that one fact
(tripl-ey6j.3):

* ``--to`` IS REQUIRED. There is no default and no "upgrade to latest"
  convenience. Refusing to guess which version you meant is the whole safety
  posture of this command.
* A DOWNGRADE IS REFUSED OUTRIGHT, with no override flag. Once ``alembic upgrade
  head`` has run, the old image does not know how to read the new schema, and
  the honest instruction is "restore your backup".
* AN UNORDERABLE PAIR (``latest``, ``sha-abc1234``, ``1.4``) says so and demands
  ``--allow-unordered-tag``, rather than inventing an ordering. NOT ``--yes``:
  every non-interactive caller must pass ``--yes`` or the backup prompt hangs
  it, so overloading that flag with "and ignore the ordering guard" turned the
  guard off on exactly the runs nobody is watching — the CI pipelines
  (tripl-jfm3). Two decisions, two flags.
* THE BACKUP IS THE OPERATOR'S. This command PRINTS the ``pg_dump`` invocation
  and refuses to continue without an acknowledgement; it never runs it. A dump
  we invoked and then called "your backup" would be a promise we cannot keep —
  we cannot know there is disk space, and the dump does not contain
  ENCRYPTION_KEY, without which its encrypted columns are unreadable.

ORDER OF OPERATIONS, and why:

    pull  ->  write the pin  ->  up -d

The pull comes first so that a bad tag or an unreachable registry leaves ``.env``
untouched. The pin is written to ``.env`` BEFORE ``up -d`` rather than passed
inline, because an inline ``TRIPL_VERSION=x docker compose pull`` applies to the
pull only and the following ``up`` then starts ``${TRIPL_VERSION:-latest}`` —
the trap ``bin/release.sh`` records as tripl-jfm3.123.

It does NOT run ``alembic`` and does NOT run ``docker compose run --rm migrate``.
The ``migrate`` one-shot with ``condition: service_completed_successfully`` is
already the documented, race-free mechanism; a second CLI-owned migration path
would be a second thing to keep in sync with the first.
