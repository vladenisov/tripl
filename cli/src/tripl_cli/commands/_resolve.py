"""``<name-or-id>`` selectors: ONE matcher, one refusal, for every command taking one.

Three arguments across the CLI accept either a name or an id — ``tripl scans``'
``<scan>``, ``tripl plan fields``' ``<event-type>`` and ``--branch`` on every
plan read — and all three resolve through ``api.scans.resolve_selectors``, which
``tripl watch``'s ``--scan`` already used. Exact on the name first, then on the
id; never a substring, never case-insensitive.

That rule is not fussiness. A ``scans run`` that triggered the wrong SQL because
two config names share a prefix is worse than one that refuses to start, and a
``--branch`` that silently guessed would answer plan questions about the wrong
revision — which is the same class of wrong answer, on a read, and quieter. So
a selector matching nothing lists the candidates and exits 2, and a selector
matching two names them both and exits 2 (tripl-3ixs).
