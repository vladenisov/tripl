"""The write-safety rules, in one place, for the CLI's first mutating commands.

``doctor``, ``status`` and ``watch`` are all read-only and a ``tk_r_`` key
suffices for every one of them. ``scans run``, ``scans cancel`` and
``drifts dismiss`` change the instance, which is a new category and needs rules
rather than habits (tripl-ey6j.5):

* THE SERVER IS THE AUTHORITY ON SCOPE. The ``tk_r_``/``tk_w_`` prefix is derived
  in ``api_key_service.py`` from the scope's first letter and says NOTHING about
  the backing user's role, so a local prefix check would be a fourth copy of a
  backend rule AND still wrong for a ``tk_w_`` key held by a viewer. The CLI
  sends the request and prints the client's 403 message, which already names all
  three possibilities.
* NEVER BLOCK ON A PROMPT IN A PIPELINE, AND NEVER AUTO-PROCEED IN ONE EITHER.
  A prompt that hangs a cron job holding a scan trigger is a defect; proceeding
  silently would make a piped invocation more dangerous than a typed one and
  make ``--yes`` meaningless. So: refuse, name ``--yes``, exit 2, send nothing.
* THE PROMPT GOES TO STDERR. ``input()`` writes its prompt to stdout, which would
  put prose inside the ``--json`` document contract.
* DECLINING EXITS 1. A script must never be able to read "the operator said no"
  as "the mutation happened".
