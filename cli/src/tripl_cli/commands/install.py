"""``tripl install`` — a fresh machine to a running instance, in one command.

It writes three files into a directory and runs ``docker compose pull`` and
``docker compose up -d`` in it, then polls ``/health`` until the instance
answers. It is IDEMPOTENT rather than one-shot: run it again and it converges —
files that already match are left alone, files that differ are reported and
kept, and the two compose commands run anyway, because "make the running stack
match what is on disk" is the useful meaning of a re-run.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO (tripl-ey6j.3):

* It does not create the owner account, connect a data source or run the first
  scan. Two of those three are unreachable with an API key at all and the third
  should not be automated — the reasoning, with the code that enforces it, is
  written out in full at the bottom of ``install/render.py``. It reads the
  instance's real bootstrap state over the unauthenticated ``/auth/status``
  instead and prints next steps that are true of THAT instance.
* It does not overwrite ``.env``, and no flag makes it. ``--force`` reaches
  ``compose.yaml`` and ``rabbitmq.conf`` only. Losing ``ENCRYPTION_KEY``
  permanently destroys every stored warehouse credential.
* It does not capture the output of ``pull``/``up -d``. See ``install/shell.py``.
