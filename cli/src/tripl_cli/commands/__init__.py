"""Subcommand registration.

Mirrors ``tripl_mcp.tools.register_all`` deliberately, so a contributor moving
between the two packages reads the same shape: one module per command, each
exposing ``register(subparsers, parent)``, and one place that lists them.

It also holds the argparse validators the commands share. They live here rather
than in a module of their own because they exist for one purpose only: a bad
``--days``, ``--timeout``, ``--until`` or ``--to`` fails at parse time with
``EXIT_USAGE``, before a socket is opened or a container is pulled.

...and, since tripl-3ixs, the three flags that are the same flag on every
command that carries them. ``--json``, ``--timeout`` and ``--project`` were
spelled out at each ``add_parser`` call, which by the sixth verb was five copies
of the timeout default and two private ``_add_timeout`` helpers in two command
modules. Thirteen verbs now take at least one of them, so they are defined once
and ``tests/test_contract.py`` walks the real parser to prove no verb got a
different default or a different range.
