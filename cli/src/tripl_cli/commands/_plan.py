"""What every ``tripl events`` and ``tripl plan`` verb does identically.

Seven verbs read seven resources and print seven tables. Everything AROUND that
— resolving ``--branch``, opening a counting reader, stamping the run, choosing
which stream the human lines go to, and writing at most one JSON document — is
the same seven times, and was already spelled six times across ``scans.py`` and
``drifts.py`` before these landed. It is spelled once here (tripl-3ixs).

The ``--branch`` rule is the load-bearing part. Every plan read is answered from
ONE revision, and which one is decided by a query parameter that
``backend/openapi.json`` does not document — ``deps.get_branch_id_override``
reads ``?branch=`` off the raw query string, so the contract test cannot see it
and cannot protect it. That makes it the one parameter here worth stating
plainly wherever it appears: absent means the live main plan, and a branch is
named by name or id through the same matcher ``<scan>`` uses, so neither can
silently resolve to something the operator did not ask for.
