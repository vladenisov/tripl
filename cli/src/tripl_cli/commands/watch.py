"""``tripl watch`` — follow mode for an operator sitting in front of an incident.

``doctor`` answers "what is broken" at a point in time. ``watch`` answers "what
is happening right now": scan jobs as they run with their replay chunk progress,
signals as they open, deliveries as they fail. Terminal output, no daemon
(tripl-ey6j.4).

It reaches NO verdict and therefore never exits 3, whatever it observes. Two
failure modes make any other answer wrong: `tripl watch --duration 300 | tee
incident.log` under `set -e` must not die at the exact moment something
interesting happens, and a CI gate built on watch would be a slower, flakier
`doctor --strict` with a worse sampling model - watch sees only what fell inside
its polls, so a green watch run proves strictly LESS than a green doctor run
while looking like it proves more.
