"""The vocabulary watch speaks: constants, rows, and the frozen event tokens.

Pure data plus total functions over it. No IO, no clock reads, no ``httpx`` — so
the whole diff layer, which is where the acceptance criterion lives, is testable
as arithmetic.

Rows keep the API payload VERBATIM in ``raw`` and expose typed accessors over it.
That is what lets ``data`` in the JSONL carry the backend's own key names with no
second spelling to drift: an operator greps ``replay_chunks_completed`` in
``tasks.py`` and in the CLI output and finds the same string.
