"""The synchronous CLI seam over an asynchronous client.

``commands.Handler`` is synchronous because a CLI owns its own ``main`` and has
to hand an exit code back to it; ``TriplClient`` is asynchronous because it is
shared with tripl-mcp, which needs it that way (tripl-ey6j.1). This module is
the only place the two meet, so a command body reads as a straight line and
exactly one ``asyncio.run`` executes per invocation.

The invariant is ONE ``asyncio.run`` PER INVOCATION, reached through one of two
NAMED bridges — not one ``asyncio.run`` in this file. There are two because
there are two kinds of caller:

``run_async``
    Everything that talks to a configured instance. Credentials are demanded
    BEFORE the event loop opens, which keeps "you have not configured a key"
    (``EXIT_USAGE``, no socket touched, nothing to report) cleanly separated
    from "the instance rejected your key" — two failures that produced the same
    shrug during the 2026-07-28..31 incident.

``run_unauthenticated``
    ``tripl install`` and ``tripl upgrade``, which poll ``/health`` and read
    ``/auth/status`` on an instance that BY DEFINITION has no credentials yet:
    the first account has not been created, so no API key can exist. Routing
    them through ``run_async`` would demand a key the operator cannot possibly
    have, and inventing one is not an option either (tripl-ey6j.3). It sends no
    ``Authorization`` header, ever, and ``tests/test_runner.py`` pins that.
