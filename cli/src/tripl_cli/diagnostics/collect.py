"""The only layer that speaks HTTP. Async, impure, and it never raises upward.

Every read is wrapped into a ``Fetched`` so a 403, a 404 and a dead socket all
arrive at the check layer as data. That is what makes doctor total: an
unreachable instance still produces a complete, parseable document instead of a
traceback (tripl-ey6j.2).

The one exception is ``raise_selection_failure``, which ``status`` calls
deliberately — status has no verdict contract, so "could not reach the instance"
is an ordinary CLI failure there rather than a finding.
