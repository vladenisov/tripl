"""The check rules: pure, synchronous, total functions of a ``Snapshot``.

Zero HTTP, zero ``await``, and no clock read that is not ``snapshot.now``. That
is what makes the interesting half of doctor testable as arithmetic, and it is
why a check may read data another check "owns" — everything was fetched before
any of this ran.

Universal rule (TRAP 3): a read that did not return 200 is NEVER treated as an
empty list. Every such case becomes ``endpoint_unexpected_status`` naming the
path and the code, because "the drift endpoint 404'd" silently read as "no
drifts" is what invalidated the 2026-07-30 audit.
