"""Every REST endpoint the commands read, grouped by the section it fills.

Single source of truth for the contract test: every (method, path) here must
exist in ``backend/openapi.json``. The path LITERALS live in ``tripl_cli.api``
now, which is also where ``tripl_mcp.contract`` takes them from — so a rename
breaks both packages loudly instead of one loudly and the other silently
(tripl-ey6j.5). What survives here is the per-section GROUPING, because a
contract failure should name the check that would have gone blind, not just a
URL, and the MCP's map is keyed by tool name instead.

``HEALTH_PATH`` is NOT here: it lives outside ``/api/v1`` and is declared
``include_in_schema=False``, so it is absent from the OpenAPI document by design
and cannot be checked against it. ``tests/test_doctor.py`` pins its location and
its unauthenticated-ness directly instead.
