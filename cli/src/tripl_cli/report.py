"""The ``--json`` documents. This module IS the machine-readable contract.

Kept small and greppable on purpose: if a key is not built here it does not
exist, so "what does tripl emit" is answerable by reading one file. That promise
is why the ``scans``/``drifts`` documents live here too rather than beside their
command modules — and it is also why this module sits at the package root rather
than inside ``diagnostics``: every command emits from it and only ``doctor``
reaches a verdict, so the package name was a claim about eight of the nine
builders below that was simply false (tripl-azhh). ``test_contract.py`` now pins
the promise instead of leaving it to a docstring: ``"schema_version"`` may be
minted in this module and nowhere else, so "split the builders per command" is
answered mechanically rather than by whoever reads this paragraph next.

STABILITY, within one ``schema_version``:

    Key names are never removed or retyped; ``status`` and ``severity`` values,
    check ``id``s and finding ``code``s are never renamed or repurposed. New
    keys, new check ids and new finding codes may appear in any release without
    a version bump — select by id, never by array index. ``title``, ``summary``
    and ``message`` are prose and may change in any release. ``generated_at``,
    ``duration_ms``, ``requests`` and ``tool_version`` vary per run. Assert on
    ``code`` and ``evidence``. Never assert on prose.

``tripl watch --json`` is JSON LINES rather than one document: one object per
line, flushed as it is produced, because a follow mode that block-buffers into
`jq` shows nothing for minutes and reads as a hang. Every line repeats the whole
envelope. The same stability rule applies to it: within one ``schema_version``
key names are never removed or retyped and event tokens are never renamed or
repurposed; new keys and new tokens may appear in any release. Select by
``event``, never by position. ``message`` is prose — assert on ``event`` and
``data``. ``schema_version`` is SHARED with the doctor and status documents; a
consumer branches on ``command``, never on a per-command version.
