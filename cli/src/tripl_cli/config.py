"""Where the instance URL and API key come from, and how they are validated.

Precedence is PER FIELD, highest first:

1. command-line flag  (``--url`` / ``--base-url``, ``--api-key``)
2. environment        (``TRIPL_BASE_URL``, ``TRIPL_API_KEY``)
3. config file        (``base_url``, ``api_key``)

Per field, not per source: ``--url https://staging`` with the key still coming
from the config file has to work. "If any flag is given, ignore the file" is a
plausible-looking bug, so it has its own test.

Nothing here touches the network, and absent values are never an error at
resolution time — only a malformed file, a bad value, or an explicit ``--config``
that does not exist. That is what lets ``main`` resolve unconditionally, before
it knows whether the subcommand needs credentials at all.
