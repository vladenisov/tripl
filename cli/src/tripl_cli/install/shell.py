"""The one seam between this CLI and the local machine.

Everything that runs a subprocess goes through ``Runner``, and nothing else in
the package imports ``subprocess`` at all. That is what lets the whole of
``install``/``upgrade`` be tested without a Docker daemon — the test suite
injects a ``FakeRunner`` that records every ``Command`` and answers with scripted
``CommandResult``s, so CI never starts a container (tripl-ey6j.3).

THE OUTPUT RULE, which the rest of the package depends on:

    PROBE commands are CAPTURED. They are short, we parse them, and their stderr
    is echoed verbatim when they fail — "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at
    unix:///var/run/docker.sock" is already the best sentence anyone will write
    about that failure and paraphrasing it loses the socket path.

    LONG-RUNNING commands (``pull``, ``up -d``) are INHERITED: ``stdout=None``,
    ``stderr=None``, straight to the operator's terminal, never captured. A
    wrapper that swallows compose's layer-pull progress and then reprints a
    summary is worse than useless — it turns a five-minute pull into an
    apparent hang and hides the one line that names the failing service.

The cost of that second rule is that compose's output cannot appear in the
``--json`` document. The document carries the ``argv``, the ``cwd`` and the
``returncode`` instead, and the docs say so.
