"""What lands on disk, and the rules that keep it from destroying anything.

Three files, and only three: ``compose.yaml``, ``infra/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf``
and ``.env``. There is deliberately NO data directory — Postgres lives in the
named volume ``pgdata18`` (compose.yaml), so an operator who backs up the
install directory has backed up the configuration and none of the data.

``infra/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`` is not optional and is the whole reason a
hand-copied ``compose.yaml`` is not enough: the compose file bind-mounts it, and
Docker's response to a missing bind-mount SOURCE is to create a DIRECTORY at
that path, after which RabbitMQ fails to start with an error that names neither
tripl nor the mount.

THE SAFETY RULES, in one place (tripl-ey6j.3):

1. ``.env`` is never overwritten. It is created, or appended to with the
   operator's confirmation, or left alone. ``--force`` does not reach it, and
   there is no flag that does: losing ``ENCRYPTION_KEY`` permanently destroys
   every stored warehouse and alert-destination credential.
2. ``.env`` and ``.env.bak.*`` are created at 0600 BY ``os.open``. Never
   ``open()`` then ``chmod`` — that leaves a window, however short, in which
   the database password and SECRET_KEY are world-readable.
3. A ``compose.yaml`` that differs from ours is the operator's, not ours. It is
   reported and kept; ``--force`` replaces it.
4. The version pin is rewritten by copy-then-replace, preserving every other
   byte: comments, blank lines, key order and the trailing newline.
