Before this there were three published recipes for ``SECRET_KEY`` alone
(``openssl rand -hex 48`` in deployment.md, ``openssl rand -base64 48 | tr '+/'
'-_'`` in .env.example, ``secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`` in the backend's own error
message) and none of them was executable, so none of them could be tested. This
module is executable, so it can be — see ``tests/test_install_files.py``, which
asserts the contracts the BACKEND actually enforces rather than the shape this
file happens to produce (tripl-ey6j.3).

Stdlib only: ``secrets`` and ``base64``. Not ``cryptography`` (a compiled
dependency this CLI must not acquire — tripl-mcp inherits everything here) and
not an ``openssl`` subprocess (not installed everywhere, and a password on an
argv is visible to ``ps(1)``).

NOTHING HERE IS EVER PRINTED. The commands report the KEY NAMES they generated;
the values exist only inside the 0600 file they are written to.
