"""Human output for ``install`` and ``upgrade``. ASCII only, TTY-identical.

Same rules as ``tripl_cli/render.py`` — no colour, no spinners, no unicode —
and the same reason: ``tripl install | tee provision.log`` and the terminal view
must be the same artifact. The column padder is imported from there rather than
re-implemented so the two families' tables cannot drift apart by a space.

``render_header`` itself does NOT fit these two commands: it prints
``tripl <cmd> - <base_url> (from <source>)``, and neither of these has a
configured instance URL — that is the whole point of them. The header here names
the DIRECTORY instead, which is what both commands actually act on.

#     accepting a password on an argv (visible to ps(1), kept in shell history -
#     the hazard cli.py already warns about for --api-key), and the session
#     cookie the reply sets is `Secure`, so over a plain-http first run httpx's
