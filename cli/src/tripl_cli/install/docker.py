"""Is there a usable Docker Engine with the Compose v2 plugin, and is it up?

Three probes in a fixed order, each one answering a question the next one
presupposes. They run BEFORE anything is written, so "you have no docker" costs
the operator an exit code and not a half-provisioned directory.

The legacy ``docker-compose`` v1 binary is DETECTED and never USED. It is named
in the error because "compose: command not found" sends people to the wrong
install page for an afternoon, but falling back to it would be a lie: the
production compose file uses ``depends_on.condition``, which is v2-only, so the
`migrate` one-shot's ``service_completed_successfully`` gate — the thing that
keeps a multi-worker deploy from racing the schema upgrade — simply does not
exist under v1 (tripl-ey6j.3).
