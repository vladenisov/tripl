"""Waiting for the stack to actually serve, and reading its bootstrap state.

``docker compose up -d`` returns as soon as the containers are CREATED, which on
a first run is a minute or more before the app answers: the `migrate` one-shot
still has to apply every Alembic revision, and only then do app and workers
start. A command that printed "installed" at that moment would be lying about
the one thing the operator cares about.

Why not ``docker compose up --wait``: its handling of a one-shot service that
exits 0 (``migrate``) has changed across Compose releases, and ``/health`` is the
probe the deployment docs already tell operators to curl. Polling it also means
we are asserting the thing we actually promise — that a browser can reach the
instance — rather than that Docker is happy (tripl-ey6j.3).
