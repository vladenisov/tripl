"""tripl — operator CLI for a running tripl instance, and the shared REST client.

Two consumers, one implementation: the ``tripl`` console script defined here and
the separate ``tripl-mcp`` distribution, which depends on this one and imports
``tripl_cli.client`` rather than carrying its own copy (tripl-ey6j.1). This repo
has grown the same defect four times over — query keys drifted four ways, the
event-name regex three, plus security headers and the signal significance gate —
so a second HTTP client was not on the table.
