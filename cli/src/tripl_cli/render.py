"""Human output. ASCII only, and byte-identical whether stdout is a TTY or a pipe.

No colour, no spinners, no cursor control, no emoji, no unicode glyphs. That is
not minimalism for its own sake: `tripl doctor | tee incident.log` and the
terminal view have to be the same artifact, and the logfile an operator pastes
into a ticket must not carry escape codes. A NO_COLOR/isatty branch is pure
polish and can be added later without changing anything here.

At the package root rather than inside ``diagnostics`` for the same reason as
``report.py``: ``render_scan_configs`` / ``render_scan_jobs`` / ``render_drifts``
/ ``render_mutation`` reach no verdict, and ``plural`` and ``columns`` are read
by ``watch.render`` and ``install.render`` as well (tripl-azhh). Both of those
re-export rather than re-implement, which is the whole point of one home.

The one import out of this module is ``api.event_types``, for the two derived
facts its tables print — how many fields an event type has, and a field's enum
options coerced to text. Those are facts about the API's payloads rather than
about layout, and computing either here would be a second copy of one the
request layer already owns (tripl-3ixs).
