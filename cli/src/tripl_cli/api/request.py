"""One REST call, described rather than performed.

A VALUE and not a call, because the two consumers need different things from
the same request: the CLI wraps a doctor/watch read into ``Fetched`` so a 403 is
data, tripl-mcp wants the exception so ``errors.py`` can reword it for an agent,
and ``--dry-run`` has to print exactly what it would have sent without sending
it. A function that both called and executed could serve only one of the three.
