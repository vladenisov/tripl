"""Every path template the two surfaces can build, assembled by resource.

``cli/tests/test_contract.py`` checks each against ``backend/openapi.json`` and
then checks that no ``.py`` in ``tripl_cli`` or ``tripl_mcp`` spells a REST path
that is not in ``ALL_TEMPLATES``. The per-resource ``ENDPOINTS`` tuples are built
from the very constants the builders ``.format()``, so the declaration and the
request cannot drift.

This does NOT replace ``diagnostics/endpoints.py`` or ``tripl_mcp.contract``.
Those two keep their own shapes because their tests assert different things — the
MCP's keys must equal the registered tool names, the CLI's are snapshot sections.
What is shared is the literal, not the declaration.
