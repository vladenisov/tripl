    something different, so a consumer that cannot tell the two regimes apart
    misreads every score. ``tripl plan search`` publishes it in the document's
    ``meta`` and ``tripl-mcp``'s ``search_plan`` in its envelope — one route, one
    reader, rather than a ``.get`` per surface (tripl-i1dt).

    Absent reads as False rather than as unknown: the backend declares
    ``SearchResponse.semantic_used: bool = False``, so a body without the key IS
    the route saying the index did not answer.

    Only a real boolean counts, for the same reason. ``bool(value)`` would read
    the string ``"false"`` — and any other truthy junk — as True, reporting that
    the semantic index answered when it did not, which inverts what every score
    in the payload means. Anything that is not a boolean is not the route making
    that claim, so it takes the same path as absent (Copilot, PR #78).

    ``total`` is ``len(items)`` after the trim, so on a full page it equals
    ``limit`` whether or not anything was dropped (tripl-wkwv.3). ``/search``
    takes no ``offset``, so the answer to a True is a bigger ``limit``.

    Absent is ``None`` rather than False HERE because the two surfaces want two
    different things from one key, and this is the one that can express both.
    ``tripl plan search`` uses it as the top rung of ``PlanRead.truncated``'s
    ladder, where "this instance predates the field" must fall through to the
    page-fullness guess instead of being published as "nothing was dropped".
    :func:`truncated` is the projection for the surface that needs a bool.
