"""The event catalog.

No projection for ``EventListItemResponse``. Its ``field_values`` and
``meta_values`` are the whole content of an event, and a CLI writes to a pipe
rather than into a model's context window — so ``tripl events list --json``
carries a row verbatim, exactly as ``scans.list_jobs`` does. The MCP's
``EVENT_LIST_FIELDS`` is a statement about an AGENT's context budget and stays
where its one consumer is (tripl-i1dt revisits that).
