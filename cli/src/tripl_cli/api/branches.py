"""Plan branches. Merge, revert and branch transitions are not built here.

Not an oversight: neither surface exposes them, because both hand that decision
back to a human in the tripl UI (see ``tripl_mcp.tools.branches``). A builder
would be the first half of shipping them.

Note how the OTHER builders spell "the live plan": by leaving ``branch`` unset.
``deps.get_branch_id_override`` resolves main whenever ``?branch=`` is missing or
empty, and refuses anything that is not a UUID belonging to this project (400) or
names no branch of it (404). So there is no literal for main, here or anywhere.
It IS a declared query parameter, so ``backend/openapi.json`` carries it and the
contract test can see it — typed ``str`` rather than ``format: uuid`` because the
dependency parses the value itself, which is what keeps a malformed id a 400
instead of FastAPI's own 422.
