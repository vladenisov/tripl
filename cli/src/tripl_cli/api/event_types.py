"""Event types, their fields, and the schema drifts detected against them.

Also the home of the two compound facts about drift that no single endpoint
answers: there is no project-level drift route, so "this project's drifts" is a
fan-out over event types under a budget, and "has anybody looked at this drift"
is a rule over ``status`` and ``snoozed_until`` rather than a field.

No projection for ``SchemaDriftResponse``. All fourteen fields are triage
material — ``resolved_by`` and ``resolution_note`` are how the 2026-07-30
field deletion was traced — so a drift is passed through verbatim.

    nothing and says nothing about not having looked.
