"""Warehouse scan configs and their job history.

Carries the two pure facts about scan configs that both surfaces need — is the
dispatcher's own query going to select this one, and which config does a
``--scan`` selector mean — because each was defined once already and a second
copy is this repository's signature defect.

No projection for ``ScanJobResponse``. Its nine fields are all load-bearing:
``result_summary`` carries the replay chunk progress ``tripl watch`` reads, and
``error_message`` is the whole answer to "why did it fail". Pass a job through
verbatim; do not add a trim here for symmetry with the config summary below.
