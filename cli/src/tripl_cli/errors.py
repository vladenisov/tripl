"""Typed failures and process exit codes.

A leaf module on purpose: ``config`` and ``client`` both raise from here and
``cli`` catches, so keeping the exceptions out of either one leaves the import
graph acyclic.

It is also what keeps ``mcp`` out of this distribution. The client used to raise
``mcp.server.fastmcp.exceptions.ToolError`` directly; importing that here would
invert the dependency (tripl-mcp depends on tripl, not the other way round) and
drag the whole MCP SDK into every ``uvx tripl`` install. tripl-mcp re-attaches
its own agent-facing wording at its tool boundary instead — see
``tripl_mcp/errors.py`` (tripl-ey6j.1).
