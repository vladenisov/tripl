"""The three probes, and the three refusals they produce.

Every one of these is a NEGATIVE: they are written first and they are the tests
that matter, because each names a failure an operator will actually hit on their
first attempt and each must cost an exit code rather than a half-provisioned
directory. Nothing here starts a container - the runner is a recorder
(tripl-ey6j.3).
