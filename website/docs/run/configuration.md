# Configuration Reference

tripl is configured entirely through environment variables. The backend reads
them into a single [`Settings`](https://github.com/vladenisov/tripl/blob/main/backend/src/tripl/config.py)
object (Pydantic `BaseSettings`); values can come from the process environment
or from a `.env` file in the backend working directory (`model_config = {"env_file": ".env", "extra": "ignore"}`).
Unknown variables are ignored, so a single `.env` can hold backend, frontend,
and Docker Compose values side by side.

The canonical starting point is
[`.env.example`](https://github.com/vladenisov/tripl/blob/main/.env.example).
Copy it to `.env` and fill in real values.

:::note Env-var names
Every setting below is matched case-insensitively by its uppercased field name:
the `database_url` field is set with `DATABASE_URL`, `rate_limit_login_per_minute`
with `RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN_PER_MINUTE`, and so on. Defaults shown are the in-code
defaults from `Settings`; the production [`compose.yaml`](https://github.com/vladenisov/tripl/blob/main/compose.yaml)
overrides several of them, as noted.
:::

## How `DEBUG` changes everything

`DEBUG` is the master switch that decides whether tripl runs in a forgiving
development posture or a locked-down production one.

- **Default:** `false`.
- **Accepted spellings** (normalized before validation): `release`, `prod`,
  `production` are treated as `false`; `dev`, `development` are treated as
  `true`. Any other value is parsed as a normal boolean.
- When `DEBUG=false`, the FastAPI lifespan calls
  `Settings.assert_production_ready()`, which **refuses to start** the process
  unless required secrets are set (see [Production startup checks](#production-startup-checks-assert_production_ready)).
- `DEBUG` also affects CORS resolution: in debug, an empty allow-list falls back
  to `*`.

:::warning
`assert_production_ready()` runs from the FastAPI app lifespan. CLI tools and
the test suite that import `Settings` directly are **not** gated by it — only a
running API process enforces the checks.

## Database & Broker

| Variable | Default | Required in prod? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql+asyncpg://tripl:tripl@localhost:5432/tripl` | Yes (must not keep dev creds) | **Async** SQLAlchemy URL used by the FastAPI app (asyncpg driver). |
| `SYNC_DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql+psycopg://tripl:tripl@localhost:5432/tripl` | Yes (must not keep dev creds) | **Sync** SQLAlchemy URL used by Alembic migrations and the Celery worker (psycopg driver). |
| `RABBITMQ_URL` | `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//` | Yes (must not keep dev creds) | Celery broker AMQP URL. |
| `REDIS_URL` | `""` (empty) | No | Cache backend. **Empty disables caching entirely** — every read falls through to PostgreSQL. |

:::danger Async vs sync URLs are not interchangeable
tripl maintains **two** PostgreSQL URLs pointing at the same database:
`DATABASE_URL` uses the async `asyncpg` driver for the web app, while
`SYNC_DATABASE_URL` uses the synchronous `psycopg` driver for Alembic and
Celery. Keep host, port, database, and credentials identical between them; only
the `+asyncpg` / `+psycopg` driver suffix differs.
:::

In the production [`compose.yaml`](https://github.com/vladenisov/tripl/blob/main/compose.yaml)
these are derived from compose-level secrets (the broker user is `tripl`, not
`guest`):

```yaml
DATABASE_URL: postgresql+asyncpg://tripl:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/tripl
SYNC_DATABASE_URL: postgresql+psycopg://tripl:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/tripl
RABBITMQ_URL: amqp://tripl:${RABBITMQ_PASSWORD}@rabbitmq:5672//
REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379/0
```

## Identity & Secrets

| Variable | Default | Required in prod? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `""` | **Yes** | Fernet key encrypting data-source and alert-destination secrets at rest. Must be a valid Fernet key. |
| `SECRET_KEY` | `""` | **Yes** | Application secret keying the HMAC over session tokens. Rotating it invalidates all existing sessions (users re-login once). |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | `""` | Effectively yes¹ | Public base URL of the deployment. Used to derive CORS origins when `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` is empty. |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` | `tripl_session` | No | Name of the session cookie. |
| `SESSION_TTL_HOURS` | `168` (24×7) | No | Session lifetime in hours. |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` | **Yes (must be `true`)** | Marks the session cookie `Secure` so it is only sent over HTTPS. |
| `DEBUG` | `false` | n/a | Master dev/prod switch — see [above](#how-debug-changes-everything). |

¹ `APP_BASE_URL` is not checked by name, but if `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` is empty
the production check fails unless `APP_BASE_URL` supplies an origin.

Generate the secrets:

```bash
# ENCRYPTION_KEY (Fernet)
python -c 'from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())'

# SECRET_KEY (any long random value)
python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))'
```

## Edge & Hardening

### CORS

| Variable | Default | Required in prod? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` | `""` | Effectively yes¹ | Comma-separated explicit origin allow-list. |

Effective origins are resolved by `Settings.cors_origins()` in this order:

1. If `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` is set, split on commas (whitespace trimmed).
2. Else if `DEBUG=true`, fall back to `["*"]`.
3. Else if `APP_BASE_URL` is set, use it (trailing slash stripped).
4. Else deny all (`[]`).

### Security headers

| Variable | Default | Required in prod? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED` | `true` | No | Toggles the security-headers middleware. |
| `HSTS_ENABLED` | `false` | No | Adds `Strict-Transport-Security`. Only safe behind HTTPS with secure cookies. |
| `HSTS_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` | `31536000` (1 year) | No | `max-age` for HSTS. |
| `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY` | `""` | No | Optional CSP. Left unset by default. When `SERVE_FRONTEND` is on and this is empty, a SPA-appropriate CSP is applied automatically. |

:::tip
The production `compose.yaml` sets `SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true` and defaults
`HSTS_ENABLED` to `true` (overridable via the `HSTS_ENABLED` env). Enable HSTS
only once you serve over HTTPS exclusively.
:::

### Frontend serving

| Variable | Default | Required in prod? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SERVE_FRONTEND` | `false` | No | When `true`, the API also serves the built SPA from `FRONTEND_DIST_DIR`, so production runs a single container. |
| `FRONTEND_DIST_DIR` | `""` | No | Path to the built SPA assets served when `SERVE_FRONTEND` is on. |

:::note
In the published image, `SERVE_FRONTEND` / `FRONTEND_DIST_DIR` are baked in —
the single `app` container serves the JSON API and the SPA on port `8000`. In
development the Vite dev server serves the SPA with HMR and proxies `/api` to
the backend, so these stay at their defaults.
:::

### Registration

| Variable | Default | Required in prod? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `REGISTRATION_MODE` | `open` | **Decide it** | Who may create an account. `open` (**the default**) allows self-service signup — anyone who can reach the instance gets an **editor** account that can read the whole tracking plan and the member roster, and edit any shared project. Data source connection details (host, port, username) are owner-only. `disabled` refuses `POST /auth/register` with `403` and hides the sign-up form. `open` is the default for historical reasons — it used to be the only way to onboard anyone. An owner can now invite people directly (**Settings → Members → Invite a member**), so `disabled` no longer blocks onboarding; set it once your team has accounts. The first registration on an **empty** instance is always allowed and becomes the owner. Overridable at runtime in **Settings → Instance → Security & access**, where it applies immediately. See [Security & Hardening](./security.md#self-service-registration). |

### Rate limiting

| Variable | Default | Required in prod? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` | `true` | No | Master toggle for auth-endpoint rate limiting. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN_PER_MINUTE` | `5` | No | Login attempts per `(ip, route)` per minute. `0` disables this limit. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_REGISTER_PER_HOUR` | `3` | No | Registrations per `(ip, route)` per hour. `0` disables this limit. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_FORWARDED_FOR` | `false` | No | Derive client IP from `X-Real-IP` / leftmost `X-Forwarded-For` instead of the socket peer. |

:::danger Only trust forwarded headers behind a trusted proxy
The limiter uses an in-memory token bucket **per worker**. Leave
`RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_FORWARDED_FOR=false` (the default) whenever the API is the
edge — including the consolidated single container. Enable it only when a
trusted proxy/LB overwrites `X-Real-IP` on every request; a raw, attacker-
controlled `X-Forwarded-For` on a directly exposed API lets a caller rotate it
per request and bypass the limit. For multi-worker deployments, front the API
with a shared limiter or LB.
:::

---

## Observability

| Variable | Default | Required in prod? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `REQUEST_ID_HEADER` | `X-Request-ID` | No | Header used to read/emit a per-request correlation ID. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | No | Log level (uppercased and trimmed). |
| `LOG_JSON` | `false` | No | Emit one-line JSON logs instead of plain text. Compose/k8s should enable this. |
| `PROMETHEUS_METRICS_ENABLED` | `false` | No | Exposes the `/metrics` endpoint and Celery task instrumentation. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `""` | No | Setting a non-empty value opts the API and worker into FastAPI/SQLAlchemy/Celery auto-instrumentation via an OTLP exporter. No-op when blank or when the `opentelemetry-*` packages are absent. |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | `tripl` | No | Service name reported by the OTLP exporter. |

:::tip
`compose.yaml` defaults `LOG_JSON` to `true` (overridable). Expose `/metrics`
only on an internal-only ingress path or scrape via a sidecar.
:::

---

## Demo workspace

Two independent switches control the generated demo project. Both default to
**on**, and neither affects real projects in any state.

| Variable | Default | Required in prod? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DEMO_ENABLED` | `true` | No | Master kill switch for demo **provisioning**. When `false`, `POST /projects/demo` **and** demo reset are refused with `403 Demo provisioning is disabled`. |
| `DEMO_RUNTIME_ENABLED` | `true` | No | Gates the `advance_demos` beat task that keeps an existing demo fresh (new buckets, jobs, and signals). When `false` that task is a no-op and existing demos keep the data they already have. |

:::note A demo's two refresh paths run at different rates
`advance_demos` runs **hourly**: it appends the newest bucket, re-runs the real
detector for volume anomalies, and records a scan job, so a demo always looks
live. The full scheduled collection — which additionally produces breakdown
anomalies and distribution drift — runs at most **every 6 hours** per demo
instead of hourly, because it costs 67–141 s against the in-memory dataset and
every demo on a deployment used to pay that every hour. Real projects are
unaffected and keep their configured `interval`.
:::

:::note Reset is a provisioning path — delete is not
A reset re-seeds a demo from scratch, so `DEMO_ENABLED=false` blocks **Create**
and **Reset** alike. **Deleting** a demo stays available in every state of both
flags, so a workspace can never be stuck with a demo it cannot remove. Real
project create / scan / delete, and the real scan and metric schedulers, are
untouched by either flag.
:::

See [The demo workspace](../use/demo-workspace.md) for what a demo contains and
which parts of it are synthetic.

## Optional features

These groups are off (or unconfigured) by default. Several enable sending plan
content or photos to external providers, so they are explicitly opt-in.

### Hybrid knowledge search (embeddings)

Lexical/fuzzy search runs locally against PostgreSQL with no extra config.
Embeddings are opt-in because indexed text may include internal tracking-plan
content sent to the configured provider.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SEARCH_EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED` | `false` | Enables embedding-backed search. |
| `SEARCH_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | `openai` | Embedding provider. |
| `SEARCH_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `text-embedding-3-small` | Embedding model. |
| `SEARCH_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` | `1536` | Vector dimensions. |
| `SEARCH_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` | `""` | Provider API key; falls back to `OPENAI_API_KEY` if empty. |
| `SEARCH_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | Base URL of an OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint; `/embeddings` is appended. Point it at a self-hosted provider to keep plan text inside your own infrastructure. Env-only, and changing it after indexing needs a re-index — see [AI and search](./ai-and-search.md). The resolved value is visible read-only under **Settings → Instance → AI**, with a source badge, so a value that never reached the container can be spotted from a browser instead of by diffing the compose file. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `""` | Shared OpenAI key used as fallback for search embeddings and AI features. |

### AI features (LLM descriptions, Q&A)

Disabled by default because plan content (event names, descriptions, field
names) is sent to the configured provider when enabled.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AI_ENABLED` | `false` | Master toggle for LLM-powered features. |
| `AI_BASE_URL` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | OpenAI-compatible base URL. |
| `AI_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | Chat/completion model. |
| `AI_API_KEY` | `""` | Provider API key; falls back to `OPENAI_API_KEY` if empty. |
| `AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `30` | Per-request timeout. |
| `AI_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | `700` | Output token cap. |

### Email alerts (SMTP)

Leaving `SMTP_HOST` blank disables email destinations: creating them still
works, but sends fail with a friendly error pointing at this config. The worker
reads these at send time, so changes take effect without re-creating
destinations.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SMTP_HOST` | `""` | SMTP server host. Blank disables email delivery. |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` | SMTP port. |
| `SMTP_USERNAME` | `""` | SMTP auth username. |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | `""` | SMTP auth password. |
| `SMTP_USE_TLS` | `true` | Use STARTTLS/TLS. |
| `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS` | `""` | Default `From:` address when a destination doesn't override it. |

### Event photo storage

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PHOTO_STORAGE_BACKEND` | `local` | `local` (filesystem, served via authenticated API endpoint) or `gcs` (Google Cloud Storage). |
| `PHOTO_LOCAL_DIR` | `./var/photos` | Directory for the `local` backend. |
| `PHOTO_MAX_SIZE_MB` | `10` | Max upload size in MB. |
| `PHOTO_ALLOWED_MIME` | `image/jpeg,image/png,image/gif,image/webp` | Allowed MIME types (comma-separated). |
| `GCS_PHOTO_BUCKET` | `""` | GCS bucket for the `gcs` backend. |
| `GCS_PHOTO_CREDENTIALS_PATH` | `""` | Service-account JSON path. Empty falls back to Application Default Credentials. |
| `GCS_PHOTO_PUBLIC` | `false` | Return public URLs instead of time-limited signed URLs. |
| `GCS_PHOTO_SIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS` | `3600` | Signed-URL lifetime when not public. |

### Warehouse query row caps

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SCAN_ROW_LIMIT_DEFAULT` | `50000` | Default row cap for scan/replay when no scan-config override is set. |
| `METRICS_ROW_LIMIT_DEFAULT` | `100000` | Default row cap for metrics queries when no override is set. |

---

## Production startup checks (`assert_production_ready`)

When `DEBUG=false`, the FastAPI lifespan refuses to start and raises a
`RuntimeError` listing every problem if any of the following hold:

1. **`ENCRYPTION_KEY` is empty** — data-source and alert-destination secrets
   would be stored as plaintext.
2. **`ENCRYPTION_KEY` is not a valid Fernet key** — it is validated by
   constructing `Fernet(key)`.
3. **`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` is false** — session cookies would be sent over
   plain HTTP.
4. **`SECRET_KEY` is empty** — session-token hashes would be unkeyed and
   guessable.
5. **Resolved CORS origins are empty** — no browser could call the API. Set
   `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` or `APP_BASE_URL`.
6. **Resolved CORS origins are exactly `["*"]`** — browsers reject credentialed
   (cookie) requests against a wildcard origin, breaking session auth. Set an
   explicit origin.
7. **`DATABASE_URL`, `SYNC_DATABASE_URL`, or `RABBITMQ_URL` still contain
   dev-default credentials** — any of the markers `tripl:tripl` or `guest:guest`
   surviving into a non-debug deploy fails the check.

:::note
These checks are pure secret/edge hygiene. Optional-feature variables
(AI, search, SMTP, photo storage, OTEL, Prometheus) are **not** validated here —
they fail gracefully or stay disabled when unconfigured.
:::

---

## Compose / deployment variables

These are consumed by Docker Compose and the image, not by the backend
`Settings` object. They appear in
[`.env.example`](https://github.com/vladenisov/tripl/blob/main/.env.example) so
one `.env` covers the whole stack.

| Variable | Default | Used by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `tripl` | PostgreSQL container | DB superuser (compose uses `tripl`). |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `tripl` | PostgreSQL container | Database name. |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | — (required) | Compose | Builds the DB URLs. The prod stack **requires** a non-default value. |
| `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD` | — (required) | Compose | Builds `RABBITMQ_URL`; broker user is `tripl`. |
| `TRIPL_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/vladenisov/tripl` | Compose | Published image to run. |
| `TRIPL_VERSION` | `latest` | Compose | Image tag — pin to a released tag in production. |
| `VITE_API_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | Frontend build | Base URL the SPA calls; baked in at build time. |

:::warning Compose enforces required secrets too
In `compose.yaml`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
`SECRET_KEY`, and `APP_BASE_URL` use the `${VAR:?...}` form, so `docker compose`
fails fast with a clear message if any is unset — before the app even runs its
own `assert_production_ready()` checks.
