/**
 * The discussion on an event itself, as opposed to on one of its attachments.
 *
 * No `branch` argument, deliberately: an event has ONE discussion, and the
 * server resolves a branch copy to its twin on main before reading or writing.
 * Passing a branch here would invite two threads on one conversation.
 *
 * On the shared client, not raw `fetch`: that kept a private copy of error
 * unwrapping and lost the 401 re-auth prompt, the `X-Request-ID` a support
 * reference needs, and `ApiError` (EVT-28).
