/**
 * Keeps the drift-review docs saying what the drift panels say (tripl-lh61).
 *
 * The wave that gave a snooze its own review state renamed the collapse toggle
 * and the revive button, and left four sentences across three published pages
 * still promising the old wording. A reader hunting for **Show N resolved** on
 * a panel that reads **Show 1 snoozed** is the person who just snoozed a drift
 * and wants it back — the one case where the name differs, and the reader most
 * likely to be looking.
 *
 * Asserting against the labels THE CODE EMITS rather than a hardcoded list is
 * the whole point: renaming a button now fails here instead of quietly making a
 * doc false, which is what happened the first time.
