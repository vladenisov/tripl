 *
 * The event fallback matters for drift scopes: they have no route of their own,

 * (tripl-wkwv.12). `getScopeMonitoringPath` answers "does a page corroborate
 * this alert?" — for a release regression the answer is still no, and nothing
 * here weakens it: the monitoring page charts its entity's volume against the

 * keyed by the SCAN and only ever describes the current latest release. This

 * which for a quarter of the production inbox had no answer at all — the event
 * name rendered as dead text and the reader had to go find it by hand on the
 * Events page, which is the complaint the linked scope name existed to fix.
 *
 * GUARDED by the COMPLEMENT of {@link getScopeMonitoringPath} rather than by a
 * second copy of the deny-set, and that form is load-bearing: it can never
 * return a path a caller is already linking, so a surface that renders both can
 * never show two links to one page — the exact failure the deny-set's own
 * comment ("no second, contradicting link is offered beside it") exists to
 * prevent. Neither branch below relaxes that guard, so it holds however the
 * deny-set changes.
 *
 * BOTH partitions of a release regression get an answer, and they are different
 * pages — the event-scoped row through its `event_id`, the event-TYPE-scoped one
 * through its `scope_ref` (see the set above). Answering only the first left the
 * event type's name as dead text beside a page that renders it perfectly well,
 * for a reason ("the row carries no event") that is true of the EVENT route and
 * says nothing about the event-type one.
 *
 * Callers must label the result as navigation and not as evidence: it is only
 * ever offered for a scope whose alert the destination cannot substantiate.
