 * these functions, so a test that ALSO derived its expectation from them would
 * move whenever the builder moved and assert nothing about the wording. Rename
 * a sentence inside `mutePresets.ts` and this file goes red with the old and
 * the new English side by side in the diff — that is the whole job.
 *
 * The three surface test files keep their own literals for the complementary
 * reason: they now compare a shared builder's output against a sentence written
 * independently per file, which is a cross-surface check none of them could
 * make while all three components hardcoded the same template.
 *
 * `TARGET` is adversarial on purpose. It contains no preset label as a
 * substring ('1h' / '24h' / '7d') and no regex metacharacter, so the
 * `toContain` assertions below cannot pass for the wrong reason and a name
 * built from it is safe to feed to `new RegExp`.
