/**
 * Canonical React Query keys for the caches that have drifted.
 *
 * A query key is a string literal, so nothing catches two spellings of the same
 * cache — the reader and the writer simply stop seeing each other and the UI
 * goes quietly stale. That has now happened three times:
 *
 * - `['data-sources']` (metric card, metric form, fact-table form and list) vs
 *   `['dataSources']`, the one DataSourcesPage invalidates and `setQueryData`s
 *   (tripl-jfm3.115) — four surfaces kept showing a source you had just edited;
 * - `['plan-branches', slug]` in the sidebar switcher vs `['planBranches', slug]`
 *   invalidated by BranchesTab (tripl-jfm3.116) — creating or merging a branch
 *   left the switcher stale;
 * - three spellings of the expanded signals list (tripl-jfm3.119).
 *
 * Importing the key instead of retyping it makes a fourth impossible: a typo is
 * a compile error rather than a silent second cache. Every key lives here now
 * (SHELL-50) — ESLint rejects an array literal as a `queryKey` anywhere else —
 * grouped by domain below.
 *
 * Within a family the narrower keys are BUILT from the wider ones
 * (`[...projectScanJobsKey(slug), scanConfigId]`), never retyped: React Query
 * matches an invalidation by prefix, so a narrower key that stopped extending
 * its prefix would silently stop being refreshed. A prefix gets its own builder
 * rather than an optional trailing argument: `key(slug)` building
 * `[family, slug, undefined]` is a three-element filter that matches no
 * branch-scoped cache (see {@link projectVariablesKey}).
