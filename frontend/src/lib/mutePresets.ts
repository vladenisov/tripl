/**
 * Preset mute durations, and the sentences the mute buttons are announced by —
 * one definition for every surface that can silence something.
 *
 * Two surfaces mute and they disagreed. `MonitorDetailPage` offered 1h / 24h /
 * 7d on labelled buttons; the incident Inbox hardcoded
 * `Date.now() + 7 * 86_400_000` inside its mutation and put the word "Mute" on
 * an unlabelled button, so an operator could not find out how long they had
 * just snoozed something for — and re-clicking Mute silently extended it
 * another week (tripl-oxkt.7).
 *
 * A preset is a DURATION, never a stored instant: the contract requires
 * `muted_until` to be in the future, so it is rendered into an absolute
 * timestamp at the moment of the click.
 *
 * There are deliberately TWO exported lists. {@link MUTE_PRESETS} is durations
 * only and is what every mute surface maps; {@link INBOX_MUTE_CHOICES} is that
 * list plus the open-ended {@link INDEFINITE_MUTE}, and only the incident Inbox
 * may map it — see the note on `INDEFINITE_MUTE` for why the same button on an
 * alert rule would UNMUTE it (tripl-a50u).
 *
 * The button NAMES live here for the same reason the durations and the
 * open-ended label do. Three surfaces — the incident Inbox, the Monitors row
 * and the monitor detail page — each re-typed `Mute <target> for <duration>`
 * and `Unmute <target>` into an `aria-label`, and each one's test file re-typed
 * them again to assert against. `MonitorDetailPage.test.tsx` even named the
 * missing piece in a comment: "the only real guard against the three surfaces
 * drifting would be a shared name builder next to `MUTE_PRESETS`". That builder
 * is {@link muteName} / {@link muteChoiceName} / {@link unmuteName} at the foot
 * of this file (tripl-yapg, tripl-in45).
 *
 * The module owns the MUTE words ONLY. A surface's own vocabulary stays with
 * that surface: the Inbox's "Change mute on <target>" (no other mute surface
 * can change a mute in place — a muted rule offers a direct Unmute) and its
 * "Reopen <target>" (not a mute word at all; it lifts acknowledge, resolve and
 * false-positive too — tripl-oxkt.3). Neither has a second surface to drift
 * from, so hosting them here would export one component's state vocabulary into
 * two components that can never use it.

/**
 * "Until I unmute" — a mute with no end at all, transmitted as a NULL
 * `muted_until`.
 *
 * A preset above is a DURATION; this is the deliberate ABSENCE of one, which is
 * why it is a separate type with `ms: null` rather than a fourth member of
 * `MUTE_PRESETS` (tripl-a50u). The split is load-bearing, not stylistic:
 *
 *  - On an INCIDENT (`alert_inbox`), `status = 'muted'` with a NULL
 *    `muted_until` is an indefinite mute: `_effective_inbox_status` only lapses
 *    a mute when `muted_until` is set AND has passed, so a NULL one never
 *    lapses and only Unmute lifts it.
 *  - On an ALERT RULE, `is_rule_muted()` returns FALSE the moment `muted_until`
 *    is NULL. The identical button on a rule surface would therefore UN-silence
 *    the rule it promised to silence forever. The permanent lever on a rule is
 *    its enable/disable switch, not a mute.
 *
 * Because `MUTE_PRESETS` is `readonly MutePreset[]` and `ms` there is `number`,
 * appending this to it is a compile error rather than a review comment — the
 * leak cannot be introduced by someone "simplifying" the two lists into one.
 *
 * The wording lives here, once, for the same reason the durations do: two
 * surfaces inventing "Forever" and "Indefinitely" for one idea is exactly the
 * vocabulary drift this module was written to stop (tripl-oxkt.7).

/**
 * The accessible name of the control that OPENS the duration menu.
 *
 * Used by the incident Inbox and by the Monitors row. Both are DISCLOSURE
 * toggles: they reveal the durations and mute nothing on their own. That is why
 * this takes no choice and never will — a button that COMMITS a mute must be
 * named by {@link muteChoiceName}, so the duration it is about to write is part
 * of its name. "Mute <target>" on a control that silently posts seven days is
 * the exact defect this module was extracted to end (tripl-oxkt.7), so an
 * optional second parameter here would be an invitation to reintroduce it.
 *
 * `target` is a plain string and not a group or a monitor, because all three
 * call sites already hold one: the Inbox passes `scopeSummary(group)`, both
 * Monitors surfaces pass the rule name. This module must not learn what a scope
 * or a rule is.
 *
 * The Inbox's already-muted counterpart, "Change mute on <target>", is
 * deliberately NOT hosted here. It exists on one surface and cannot exist on
 * another — when a rule is muted both Monitors surfaces replace the control
 * with a direct Unmute, so there is no change-in-place affordance to name — and
 * therefore no second vocabulary for it to drift from. The Inbox reads
 * `isMuted ? `Change mute on ${target}` : muteName(target)`: an asymmetric
 * ternary on purpose, because one branch is shared vocabulary and the other is
 * that surface's own. Renaming this function is the one change that could
 * desynchronise those two branches, so grep for the ternary when you do
 * (tripl-yapg, tripl-oxkt.3).

/**
 * The accessible name of a button that COMMITS a mute — the one form that has
 * to say how long for.
 *
 * It covers both offered shapes and selects between them on `choice.ms === null`,
 * the same discriminant {@link muteChoiceUntilIso} branches on. The module now
 * decides twice from one fact — once for the wire value, once for the words —
 * which is a legible symmetry rather than a duplicated condition, and it is why
 * the parameter is a `MuteChoice` and never a label string: keying the phrasing
 * off wording would let a rule surface reach the open-ended sentence by passing
 * `INDEFINITE_MUTE.label`, and `is_rule_muted()` reads what that button writes
 * as NOT MUTED (tripl-a50u).
 *
 * THE ASYMMETRY, which is the strongest single reason this function exists. The
 * open-ended button's visible face is `INDEFINITE_MUTE.label` ("Until I
 * unmute") but its accessible name is "…until unmuted", because splicing the
 * label into the duration sentence yields "Mute <target> for Until I unmute",
 * which is not English. That knowledge used to live in a comment beside the one
 * call site that had the branch; a fourth mute surface would have had to
 * rediscover it (tripl-yapg).
 *
 * It is also a KNOWN, deliberate WCAG 2.5.3 (Label in Name) deviation, and the
 * only one in this module: for every {@link MUTE_PRESETS} entry the visible
 * label is a substring of the accessible name, so "click 1h" keeps working for
 * speech input — but "click Until I unmute" does not activate the open-ended
 * button, because that phrase is not in its name. `mutePresets.test.ts` asserts
 * the deviation rather than ignoring it, so it stays singular: a fifth form
 * must either satisfy the substring property or be added there, visibly, with a
 * reason.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT WIDEN. Accepting a `MuteChoice` does not let a rule
 * surface offer the open-ended form. That guarantee lives exactly where it
 * always did and is untouched by this file's new section: `MUTE_PRESETS` is
 * `readonly MutePreset[]` whose `ms` is `number`, so a surface mapping it holds
 * only `MutePreset` values and its call here is statically confined to the
 * duration branch. Reaching the other branch still requires importing
 * `INDEFINITE_MUTE` or `INBOX_MUTE_CHOICES` by name — a visible, greppable,
 * reviewable act (tripl-a50u).
 *
 * ONE CANARY IS LOST, and is replaced deliberately. The two rule surfaces used
 * to write the duration sentence as a literal, so an open-ended choice reaching
 * them would have rendered the visibly broken "Mute X for Until I unmute". They
 * now call this, so the same leak would read as grammatical English and could
 * ship unnoticed. The replacement is behavioural and strictly stronger: both
 * rule surfaces assert that no button carrying the open-ended NAME is rendered,
 * and they build that name with this function so the guard cannot go stale the
 * day the phrasing is reworded (`MonitorsSection.test.tsx`,
 * `MonitorDetailPage.test.tsx`).
