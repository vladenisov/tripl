/**
 * Canonical plan-coverage formatting.
 *
 * Coverage is the share of active events that are implemented. Screens used to
 * format it ad hoc (`Math.round(...)` on one page, `toFixed(1)` on another),
 * which let the SAME ratio render as "99%" in one place and "100.0%" in
 * another. The rules here keep every surface consistent:
 *
 *  - only a fully-covered plan (implemented >= active) ever shows "100%";
 *  - everything else is shown to one decimal place;
 *  - a partial plan can never round UP to a perfect score — a value that would
 *    format as "100.0%" is clamped down to "99.9%" so the display never lies.
