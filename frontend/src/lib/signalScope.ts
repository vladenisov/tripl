/**
 * "<Scope> · <name>" for one signal, or null when the server could not name it.
 *
 * One definition, because there were three and one had drifted: the top bar's
 * copy ended in `return \`event ${shortRef}\``, so every scope it did not name
 * explicitly — metric, schema drift, distribution drift, variable-value drift,
 * release regression — was announced to the operator as an *event*
 * (tripl-jfm3.120). Those scopes only became reachable in the bell when it
 * switched to the expanded list (tripl-jfm3.89), which is how a wrong fallback
 * that had always been there started lying out loud.
 *
 * The name rides on the signal. `_attach_scope_names` resolves event ->
 * `Event.name`, event_type -> `EventType.display_name` and metric -> the
 * catalog `display_name` in three batched queries for the whole page, so no
 * surface downloads a catalog to label a row: the bell fanned out one GET per
 * event id plus the event-type list and the metrics catalog, Overview kept a
 * second copy of that same machinery, and both printed "Event d4c684dd" until
 * it landed (tripl-y4wt).
 *
 * A null name is terminal, never "not here yet": the scope FKs are
 * `ondelete=SET NULL`, and the kinds with no entity behind them (schema,
 * distribution, release regression, value drift) are never named at all. Render
 * {@link unnamedScopeLabel} for it — printing the ref in its place is the whole
 * of tripl-y4wt.
