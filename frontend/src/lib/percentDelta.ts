/**
 * How a percent delta is written, everywhere it is shown.
 *
 * The percent gate deliberately admits anomalies with no baseline at all
 * (tripl-l429.12) — a scope resuming after an outage, an event firing for the
 * first time, a schema drift — and every one of those arrives with
 * `expected_count` 0. `percent_delta` is stored 0.0 for them because the ratio
 * is undefined and the column is NOT NULL, so printing it reported the largest
 * possible relative move as the smallest one (tripl-l429.24). The absolute delta
 * is what there is to report for that class, and it sits in its own column.
 *
 * Mirrors the backend's `alert_templates` — `has_baseline`, `percent_delta_of`,
 * `format_percent_delta` — which fill the `${percent_delta_label}` variable in
 * the alert message. The two describe the SAME stored row — the delivery item —
 * so they have to say the same thing.

 * Was there an expectation to divide by?
 *
 * ZERO is the no-baseline condition, and it is the ONLY one — the mirror of the
 * backend's `alert_templates.has_baseline` (tripl-0zpq.102).
 *
 * A NEGATIVE expectation is a REAL baseline. A `fact` sum/avg/min/max over a
 * signed column, or a `sql` level that legitimately sits below zero, has a level
 * of -100 that is exactly as substantial as one of +100; the detector scores that
 * series on magnitude and the matcher fires on it the same way
 * (`alerting_matching.rule_matches_anomaly` compares `abs(expected)` against
 * `min_expected_count` and `absolute_delta / abs(expected)` against
 * `min_percent_delta`). A reader still asking `expected > 0` therefore prints
 * "no baseline" over the very number that made the rule fire — the renderer
 * contradicting the matcher, and on this side of the wire that is what the user
 * actually sees in the inbox row and the rule replay table.
 *
 * It is one function rather than the same expression repeated per reader because
 * the repetition is exactly how the signed fix reached the backend matcher and
 * left the renderers behind. Every frontend surface that decides "was there a
 * baseline" should route through here.
 *
 * Non-finite input is treated as no baseline. The backend cannot receive it —
 * the column is a float — but the old guards here were written `expected > 0`
 * and `!(expected > 0)`, which answered "no baseline" for a `NaN` arriving from
 * a malformed payload. `!== 0` alone would answer "yes" and go on to render
 * "NaN%", so the check stays explicit rather than relying on the comparison's
 * side effect.

/**
 * The signed percentage a value moved against its baseline, or `null` when there
 * is no baseline to divide by.
 *
 * For the surfaces that hold the two counts and compute the ratio themselves —
 * a top-mover row, a monitoring signal banner — rather than reading a stored
 * `percent_delta`. Same {@link hasBaseline} gate as {@link formatPercentDelta}
 * and the backend's `alert_templates`, so no surface can decide on its own that
 * a zero baseline is a baseline.
 *
 * MAGNITUDE and SIGN are decided separately, and the divisor is what makes that
 * possible:
 *
 *  - the magnitude is the backend's, exactly: `Math.abs(ratioDelta(a, e))` is
 *    `abs(a - e) / abs(e) * 100`, the definition in
 *    `alert_templates.percent_delta_of`. Dividing by `abs(expected)` is the
 *    whole fix — a -3 baseline observed at -9 is a 200% move, the same size as
 *    3 observed at 9.
 *  - the sign is the direction of travel on the number line,
 *    `Math.sign(actual - expected)`, which is precisely how the backend picks
 *    the arrow: `anomaly_detector` sets `direction = "spike" if actual >=
 *    expected else "drop"`, with no reference to the baseline's own sign.
 *
 * Signing by the OLD expression `(actual - expected) / expected` flipped under a
 * negative baseline: -3 falling to -9 came out `+200%`, so the banner rendered a
 * down arrow (`direction === 'drop'`) beside a rising percentage. Every caller
 * takes its arrow and its colour from `direction`, never from this number, so
 * that disagreement was visible on screen and is what this sign rule removes.
 * For a POSITIVE baseline the two expressions are identical, so no existing row
 * moves.
