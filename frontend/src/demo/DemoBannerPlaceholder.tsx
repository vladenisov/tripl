/**
 * The demo banner's box, held while its lazy chunk loads (#251 SH-2).
 *
 * The banner is its own chunk, so on a hard load the page rendered first and
 * the bar arrived ~1s later, pushing everything down 62px just as the user
 * started reading. The shell's Suspense boundary shows this instead: the same
 * footprint — the phone pill below `lg`, the one-line bar from `lg` up, and
 * the banner's bottom margin — so nothing moves when the real one lands.
 *
 * The bar is the banner's own structure — a bordered panel around an `h-11`
 * row — so its 2px of border are counted the same way: a bare `h-11` box was
 * 44px against the banner's 46.
 *
 * It carries `data-demo-banner` like the real one, so a docked coach card that
 * mounts before the banner's chunk already starts below it (#251 SH-5).
 *
 * Deliberately tiny and dependency-free: the shell imports it statically,
 * into the entry chunk.
