/**
 * The coached demo scenario, on the surface itself (tripl-2su6.21.4).
 *
 * The strip tells the user what the next step is; this points at the button that
 * does it. Product pages wrap their action element and name a step — they learn
 * nothing about scenario state, and a page that is not part of any scenario, or
 * a project that is not a demo, renders exactly what it always rendered: the
 * Popover root and its asChild anchor add no DOM, the anchor gets no extra
 * props, and no card, ring or portal is mounted.
 *
 * A coach mark is a hint, never a dialog. It never takes focus from the control
 * it points at, never traps it, and cannot be broken by Escape or a click
 * elsewhere — the scenario is not something the user can accidentally cancel.
 * The one control it offers is "Hide hints", which quiets the marks for the
 * browser session (per project, in sessionStorage) while leaving the scenario
 * running and the strip coaching. The strip offers the same toggle, so a
 * keyboard user does not have to Tab through the whole page to the portalled
 * card to reach it (DEMO-12).
 *
 * One gate controls everything this file does (tripl-odrj.2): the card, the
 * pulsing ring around the anchor, the one-shot scroll to an off-screen anchor,
 * and the presence report the strip reads all key off the same `visible`.
