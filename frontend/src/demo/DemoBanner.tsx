/**
 * Persistent demo banner (tripl-2su6.9).
 *
 * Shown across every surface of a demo project (mounted in the app Layout). It
 * makes the workspace's synthetic/local nature unmistakable, shows the recipe
 * version and runtime freshness, and exposes Reset / Delete — both confirmed,
 * both scoped to the demo endpoints, both offered only to the demo's creator or
 * a workspace owner. On delete it returns to the Projects list.
 *
 * It also owns the one way back into the guided onboarding (tripl-imco): being
 * mounted on every demo surface, its "Tour & chapters" opens the tour, and the
 * tour offers the dismissed welcome panel back (DEMO-26).
 *
 * One row, not a stack (LIVE-9): the banner and the scenario strip used to be
 * two blocks above every page title, ~170 px on a desktop and ~250 px on a
 * phone. The strip now arrives as the `scenario` slot and sits in the middle of
 * the banner's own row — about 44 px, on one line from `lg` up, where the
 * actions give up their visible labels while a scenario shares the row (their
 * names stay). Below `lg` the whole bar folds into a pill that opens it.
