/**
 * Expected phases of a synchronous demo-project provision (tripl-2su6.9).
 *
 * Provisioning is a single blocking `POST /projects/demo` with NO mid-request
 * stage polling — the response is terminal (ready or 500). The progress UI
 * therefore *estimates* its way through these expected phases on a timer so the
 * wait reads as staged work rather than an indefinite spinner. The client cannot
 * know which phase the server is really in, so the UI presents the list as an
 * estimate and only marks work done once the request itself resolves
 * (tripl-jfm3.16). The real outcome comes from the request resolving, not from
 * any phase reaching the end.
