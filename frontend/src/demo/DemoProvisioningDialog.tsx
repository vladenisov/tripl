/**
 * Demo-provisioning progress + outcome dialog (tripl-2su6.9).
 *
 * Shows estimated staged progress during the single blocking create and an
 * inline, human error with a Retry action on 500. Accessibility:
 *  - Radix Dialog traps focus and restores it on close;
 *  - an `aria-live` region announces the current phase and the final result;
 *  - every terminal state (success, cancelled, failed) says so visibly and
 *    offers a positive action — never a disabled Cancel under a title that
 *    still claims work is in progress (tripl-jfm3.15).
 *
 * A create in flight is abandonable, and cancelling is honest about what the
 * server could do: the phase list is labelled an estimate rather than asserting
 * completed work the client cannot observe (tripl-jfm3.16), and a cancel that
 * arrived too late says the demo is going to appear (tripl-jfm3.12).
