/**
 * Drives the estimated phase pointer for a blocking demo request.
 *
 * There is no server-side stage feed for either create or reset, so the pointer
 * is a timer. This is the ONE copy of that loop (DEMO-22): the reset dialog
 * mounts it only while its request is in flight, and the create controller
 * passes `running` — each time it turns true the pointer starts again from
 * phase 0, so a retry never resumes where the failed attempt parked.
