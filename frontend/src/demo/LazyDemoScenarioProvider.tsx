/**
 * The coached demo scenario as the app shell mounts it (tripl-fj5g.15).
 *
 * A thin context: the scenario model and its runtime are a chunk of their own,
 * fetched only when the project in scope is a ready demo — every other project
 * never downloads them. Until the chunk lands (and for every non-demo project)
 * the contexts hold their inert values, which every consumer already handles.
 *
 * The runtime renders beside the children and publishes up, rather than
 * wrapping them, so the page keeps its place in the tree however the scenario
 * loads; see DemoScenarioRuntime.
