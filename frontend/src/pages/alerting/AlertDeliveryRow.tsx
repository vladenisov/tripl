/**
 * The delivery table: its fixed columns, their widths, and the rows.
 *
 * One component for both places a delivery list renders — the Delivery log and
 * the "what was sent" table inside an incident card. The card's copy used to
 * hand-roll its own header, still titled "Error / Preview" long after the log
 * renamed that column "What fired", and without the `table-fixed` widths this
 * row's truncating cells rely on (ALR-32).
 *
 * `table-fixed` plus explicit widths: without it the multi-kilobyte summary
 * cell's max-width never bound, every short column collapsed to min-content and
 * a single timestamp wrapped over four lines, inflating rows to ~100px
 * (tripl-oxkt.18). The min-width is what the eight columns actually need; the
 * Table's own container scrolls, so the page body never does.
 *
 * Below `md` each row is a card instead (AL-20): time · status, then the
 * destination, the rule and what fired, stacked. At 390px the table used to
 * scroll sideways with only Time, Status and Destination in view. The cards are
 * the same rows restyled by CSS rather than a second rendering, so there is one
 * set of cells to keep right; the header stays for screen readers only.
