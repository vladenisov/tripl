 * The unsent note on each incident card, held outside React state (ALR-29).
 *
 * The drafts used to be a `Record` in ProjectAlertingTab's state, so every
 * keystroke in any card re-rendered the whole page and all 50–250 cards under
 * it. They still have to be owned by the page — a draft outlives a section
 * switch, and the action mutation that sends it lives there — but nothing on
 * the page needs to re-render when one changes except the card it belongs to.
 * A tiny store with per-card subscriptions gives exactly that: the page holds
 * the store (one stable object), and each card subscribes to its own key.
