 * — arrives later, and without this the reader had to reopen the row to learn
 * the retry had failed again.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT tied to the row's lifetime: the refetch a retry triggers can
 * move the row off a Status=Failed page, which is exactly when the reader most
 * needs to hear it failed. Bounded by `attempts`, and a failed look ends the
 * watch silently — the row and the log still show the truth.
 *
