 * (tripl-a50u): `undefined` = no mute value at all, a string = mute until that
 * instant, `null` = mute with NO end. Nothing downstream may branch on
 * truthiness — a `&& mutedUntil` drops the key from the request body for
 * exactly the most far-reaching choice on the bar.

 *    the button unspellable rather than merely absent, so this comment is not
 *    the only guard. It stays available on each incident's own action row.
 *  - "Select all N matching". The events bar offers it because a status change
 *    there is cheap and reversible; here the cheapest thing on the bar silences
 *    alerting for a whole scope, and the batch is capped at
 *    {@link MAX_BULK_INBOX_ACTION_GROUPS} anyway. Selecting is deliberately
