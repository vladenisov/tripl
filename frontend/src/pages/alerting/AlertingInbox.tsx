          control on the card that cannot tell them apart. It also means a test

          There are now THREE cases, and `muted` is the only signal that
          separates two of them, so the outer guard must stay exactly as it is:
            - in force, dated    → muted = true,  muted_until = <future>
            - in force, no end   → muted = true,  muted_until = null (tripl-a50u)
            - lapsed             → muted = false, muted_until = null
          Rewriting this around `muted_until` — the obvious way to make the
          open-ended case render — puts the "Open badge + mute line" card
          straight back. And dropping the inner branch is just as bad the other
          way: an indefinite mute would then say nothing at all, which is the
          silent mute tripl-oxkt.7 exists to remove.

          The open-ended row keeps status `muted` like any other, so the chip
          and the Muted filter need no special case — but its sort key is frozen
          and it never lapses, so it sinks out of the 30-day window for good and
          that filter is the only route back to its Unmute (tripl-oxkt.2). */}
