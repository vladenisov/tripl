/**
 * An example of the two namespaces, drawn from the project's own variables.
 *
 * A reader asked whether the dotted path under **Data bindings** and the dotted
 * token offered after `$` in a field value are the same thing. They are not —
 * one is a warehouse address, the other is a variable's name — and the hard-
 * coded example made it worse rather than better: `page_data.extra.variant` is
 * three segments deep in a container their warehouse does not have, so it read
 * as a different namespace from the two-segment names they pick from the token
 * list (tripl-htfn.3).
 *
 * They look alike for a reason worth showing rather than explaining: a scan
 * that discovers a path stores it as the binding AND, when every short name is
 * taken, as the name too. So the instructive example is a variable whose name
 * DIFFERS from its binding — it shows both roles at once, in the project's own
 * vocabulary. One where they match teaches nothing, and is preferred only if
 * there is nothing else.
 *
 * Deterministic: ties break on the shortest binding, then alphabetically. An
 * example that changed between renders would read as a list rather than as an
 * example.
