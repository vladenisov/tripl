 * The one sentence that separates the two dotted things on this screen.

 * A reader asked whether the path under Data bindings and the token offered
 * after `$` in a field value are the same. They are not — a binding is a
 * warehouse address, a token is a variable's NAME — and they look alike because
 * a scan that discovers a path stores it as the binding and, when every short
 * name is taken, as the name too. Showing the project's own pair says that
 * faster than explaining it (tripl-htfn.3).
