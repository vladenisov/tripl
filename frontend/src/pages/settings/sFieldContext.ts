 * The event-type forms' label and hint were plain text beside their control, so
 * Name, Regex, Min and the rest were announced as an unlabeled "edit text" and
 * their hints were never read at all (PLAN-36). `SField` now renders a real
 * `<label>` through the settings kit's control-id slot (field-control-id.ts);
 * this carries the other half, the hint, to `aria-describedby`.
 *
 * Its own module because a file that exports components may not also export
 * hooks without breaking fast refresh.
