 * would be putting two rows on one name. The revert endpoint asks something
 * strictly narrower and deliberately main-free: `_row_renamed_from` looks for a
 * branch row still carrying the removed row's `source_name` ("a rename main
 * happens to have raced is still a rename here") and moves the name back onto
 * it. So on exactly that branch the dialog used to promise a restore and the
 * button performed a rename: the addition the reviewer was looking at vanished
 * and nothing came back.
 *
 * That narrower question is answerable here, because the diff entries carry
 * `source_name` on both sides. This mirrors the endpoint's rule: one candidate
 * moves the name, two or more is ambiguous and refused rather than guessed at.
 *
 * It scans the diff entries and not the whole branch, so it can only see rows
 * that differ from the base. Live rows cannot hold one identity twice — events
 * carry `uq_event_scan_identity` per event type, variables
 * `uq_variable_project_source_name` — but the base is a snapshot payload, data
 * the key never checked, and one taken before the key can name an identity on
 * two rows. A branch row identical to such a base row is then invisible here
 * while the endpoint's query sees it. The gap is a base-side ambiguity the
