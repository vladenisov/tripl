/**
 * The variables table's bulk selection, and the parts of its invariant that do
 * not need the page's controls.
 *
 * The invariant: the selection only ever names rows the operator can see in the
 * current match set. Four things move that set, and each is held where it
 * happens:
 *
 *  - a control that redraws the match set wholesale (filter text, usage filter)
 *    clears the selection — `clear`, called by the page's `changeMatchSet`;
 *  - a row-level action that moves ONE row out (Exclude, Delete) drops that id
 *    — `deselect`;
 *  - a branch switch clears it — here, beside the state;
 *  - data moving under a selection nobody touched is pruned — here, given the
 *    ids that still match.
 *
 * See VariablesTab for why each of those exists (tripl-42en).

  // The bar then read "12 selected" for twelve ids that are not on the branch
  // now on screen, and every bulk action carried them: `_load_variables_by_ids`
  // filters by branch and 404s the WHOLE call on the first id it cannot find, so
  // a bulk edit aimed at the rows in front of the operator failed wholesale
  // (tripl-42en).
  //
  // The reset lives beside the state it guards because the sidebar switcher has
  // no way to call a helper in the page. Adjusting during render with an
  // equality guard is how this repo follows a prop change (see
  // ProjectAlertingTab.tsx); an effect would let one frame of the new branch
  // paint under the old count.

  // documented values or for an edit someone made, so the update makes its own
  // rows stop being "unused" and the list comes back without them. The bar was
  // then left floating "12 selected", with a Delete button, over the "Nothing to
  // retire" empty state. A colleague's delete and a retiring scan land here too.
  //
  // This is not the intersection `changeMatchSet` rejects: a filter change clears
  // the selection before it can ever reach this line. Pruning during render
  // converges in one extra render; an effect would leave a window in which
  // Delete could post ids the page had already decided to forget.
