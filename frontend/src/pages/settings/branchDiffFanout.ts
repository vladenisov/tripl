/**
 * Where the Branches tab's ahead/behind badges come from.
 *
 * They used to cost one `/branches/{id}/diff` per feature branch — a
 * server-side plan comparison measured at 2-3.5 s on a real project — capped at
 * eight rows (tripl-jfm3.50). `GET /branches?include_diff_counts=true` returns
 * `ahead` / `behind_base` for every open branch off one shared main snapshot, so
 * the list now reads those and fires no diff at all (PLAN-3). Merged and closed
 * branches come back without counts, and get no badge: a landed branch is not
 * ahead of anything.
 *
 * Lives outside the component files so they stay component-only
 * (react-refresh) and the policy is unit-testable on its own.
