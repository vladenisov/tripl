/**
 * Declares the columns a run would skip as fields on the scan's event type.
 *
 * The list is the DRY RUN's `unmapped_columns` — never a second computation.
 * This component used to derive "which columns have no field" itself, excluding
 * only the event type column and the time column, while the preview panel
 * rendered directly above it derived the same idea from the backend's full
 * `reserved_catalog_columns` set (app version, platform, event-group-rule and
 * name-format columns too). Two answers to one question, one above the other, on
 * the same screen: the panel listed `app_version` as reserved — "tripl already
 * uses these, so they never become event fields" — while this button offered to
 * create a field for it, which `plan_column_meta` would then fold into event
 * identity on every subsequent run.
 *
 * So there is no local reserved set here any more. The answer is computed once,
 * by the backend, from the draft the dry run actually ran on; this component
 * turns it into an action. It renders only while that answer is current — a
 * stale answer names columns for the event type the user has since changed away
 * from, and creating fields on the wrong event type is not recoverable from this
 * form.
