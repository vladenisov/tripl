 * Re-run a dry run on its own once its inputs settle — but only once the
 * author has run it by hand (MT-19). A preview reaches a warehouse, so the
 * first run is always a click; after that, an edit that makes the shown
 * result stale re-runs it `delayMs` after the last keystroke instead of
 * leaving the author to press Preview again.
 *
 * `stale` is the caller's "the shown result no longer describes the inputs,
 * and they are complete enough to run". Every change to `inputKey` restarts
 * the wait, so typing never fires a request per character.
