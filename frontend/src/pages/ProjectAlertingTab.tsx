   * announce itself at all.
   *
   * Three things drop rows and all three are covered by pruning against what is
   * rendered, rather than by a handler on each: a status filter change (the
   * query key changes, so `inbox` goes undefined and the whole selection
   * clears), the 60s adaptive refetch or a colleague's action removing a row
   * from the filtered set, and leaving the Inbox section entirely (the query is
   * gated on `section`, so the selection does not outlive the tab that built
   * it).
   *
   * Adjusting state during render is React's documented way to react to a
   * change in derived data; the length guard makes it converge in one extra
   * render. An effect would let one paint through with a stale count on screen,
