 * The Discussion composer on the CREATE form.
 *
 * A comment needs an event to hang on, so the thread itself cannot exist yet —
 * but the question does. "Should this fire on cancel too?" occurs while the
 * event is being authored, and by the time it exists its author has navigated
 * away (tripl-htfn.1).
 *
 * It is not Description and not Title, and the copy says so: everything else on
 * this page travels with the event into the spec the implementer reads, while
 * this is the one box that does not.
 *
 * The form's own card and textarea (AU-8): it used to be a `rounded-md p-3`
 * box with a bigger textarea and no header rule, which read as a widget pasted
 * below the form rather than one more section of it.
