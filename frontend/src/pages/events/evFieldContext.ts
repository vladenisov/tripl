 *
 * The hints on this form are consequential — "Saving this stops scans from
 * updating the field", "An event already answers to this name" — and they were
 * visual only, so a screen-reader user tabbing into the box heard the label and
 * nothing of what typing into it would do (EVT-48). The controls read this
 * rather than taking a prop because a row's control is often nested a few
 * components deep (a coach mark, a field-type switch).
