/**
 * What this instance found in its environment at startup.

 * Every row used to map `active -> success + pulse`, which rendered the two
 * rows that matter backwards: "Debug mode" on was a pulsing green "Configured"
 * while "Encryption key" unset was the same neutral grey as the optional OpenAI
 * fallback key (tripl-lgr4). `active` means "set", not "healthy" — and for
 * `debug` it means the opposite — so each row now states its own judgement.
 *
 * The judgements are the ones backend/src/tripl/config.py already makes:
 *  - `debug` true returns early from `assert_production_ready` (config.py:286),
 *    skipping every startup check, and lets CORS fall back to "*"
 *    (config.py:263). On is a warning, not a pass.
 *  - an empty ENCRYPTION_KEY is one of those refused-boot problems: "data-source
 *    and alert-destination secrets would be stored as plaintext"
 *    (config.py:291). Unset is danger, not neutral.
 *  - REDIS_URL and OPENAI_API_KEY are the only two that are genuinely optional:
 *    cache.py no-ops without Redis, and the OpenAI key is a fallback for the AI
 *    and embedding keys (config.py:348-351). Unset is neutral for those two and
 *    for nothing else.
