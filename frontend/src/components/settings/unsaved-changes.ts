 * A draft a settings section holds in component state and would lose if the

 * Instance settings are the only section with a real one: the draft is plain
 * state in ServiceSettingsPage, so leaving the instance group threw away a
 * hand-written system prompt with no warning (tripl-l8v2). Switching *within*
 * the group keeps it — InstanceSection is a module-scope lazy() ref rendered
 * without a key, so AI → Email preserves the draft — which is why the guard is
 * a predicate over the target path rather than a blanket "is dirty" block.
 *
 * Registering also arms the shell's browser-level guards — Back and
 * reload/close — for as long as the draft is registered (tripl-l33u.6), so a
 * section that forgets to pass `null` after saving leaves them armed.
