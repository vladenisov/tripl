 * A small info icon beside a term a PM may not know ("Coverage",

 * one-line definition, and a click opens the term's row on the Concepts page
 * (#238 JR-31). Meant for a PageHeader `titleAddon`.
 *
 * `term` must be the glossary's own spelling, since the anchor is derived from
 * it; `definition` is the line to show, kept short. It carries its own
 * TooltipProvider, as IconButton does, so a page renders it outside the app's
 * root provider too (page tests mount without one).
