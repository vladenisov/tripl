 * The welcome hero and the Concepts page each wrote their own description of
 * the same three pillars, and the two had already drifted apart: the hero said
 * anomaly detection needed "Nothing to configure" while Concepts explained the
 * scans and monitors that have to be set up (WS-46). Both now take the names,
 * taglines and icons from here. Lives apart from any component so tests can
 * import it without tripping react-refresh's components-only rule.
