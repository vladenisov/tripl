/**
 * The initials a user avatar shows, derived ONE way everywhere (DS-32).
 *
 * Four copies used to disagree: some took the first letter of the first two
 * words, one took two letters of the first word whatever the name, and one
 * fell back to "?" where the others showed "•". The same account then read
 * "JS" in the sidebar and "JO" on another page.
 *
 * - "John Smith Doe" → "JS" (first letters of the first two words)
 * - "alice" / "alice@example.com" → "AL" (first two letters)
 * - blank → "•"
