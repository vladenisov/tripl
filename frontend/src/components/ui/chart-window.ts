/**
 * The empty buckets that stretch a series out to the window the reader asked
 * for (MON-22).
 *
 * A categorical x-axis spans only the buckets it is given, so a scope that
 * started reporting two days into a 30-day window drew those two days
 * edge-to-edge — "30 days" on the range picker, two days on the axis, and
 * nothing saying the other 28 were empty. Padding the ends with valueless
 * buckets keeps the axis honest without inventing zeros: the line simply does
 * not reach them.
 *
 * Only the ENDS are padded. Gaps inside the series are the server's to
 * densify, and it does, per scope; a client guess at an interior bucket would
 * disagree with it at every DST shift and month boundary.
