/**
 * Guided first-run checklist (UX-24). A newcomer lands on the Overview with no
 * "start here"; this surfaces the core loop as up to five concrete steps, in
 * the order of the fastest path: connect, scan, review, metric, alert (JR-2;
 * the steps themselves live in onboarding-steps.ts). Each step's done-state is
 * derived from REAL project state (the cheap project summary + the
 * data-sources count already loaded by the Overview), so steps tick off automatically as the user makes progress —
 * nothing is stored as a manual "I did this" flag.
 *
 * It is deliberately compact and self-effacing: the X is a *persistent*
 * dismiss, remembered per project in localStorage (lib/onboardingDismissal.ts),
 * so once dismissed it stays dismissed across remounts and later visits. It is
 * not a one-way door: the dismissal offers Undo, and the command palette's
 * "Show getting started" brings it back (WS-35). The card also
 * auto-hides on its own in two cases so it never becomes permanent chrome
 * (tripl-7l83.12): once every step is complete, and — crucially for a mature
 * project — once the core loop is set up and coverage is high but the only
 * remaining step is an optional one the owner deliberately skipped (e.g.
 * alerting). Genuinely new / low-coverage projects still see it. When the user
 * is all-but-done (every step bar the last), it collapses to a slim one-line bar
 * naming the single remaining step, which can be expanded on demand, so a
 * nearly-onboarded project isn't dominated by a tall card (fix #13).
 *
 * The checklist is role-aware (tripl-yfsj.4). Some steps are actionable only by
 * an owner — connecting a data source is owner-only — and a self-registered /
 * invited user is an editor, not an owner. For a non-owner an owner-only step
 * would otherwise be a silent dead-end (they see the list with no "Add
 * connection" button and can never tick it off), so it is shown but marked
 * "Owner only" with an ask-an-owner hint AND excluded from progress: it never
 * blocks completion, letting an editor's checklist actually reach done.
