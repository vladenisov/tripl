/**
 * Variant groups in the command palette's search results (#238 JR-20).
 *
 * The search service folds events of one event type whose names differ only in
 * one naming-rule placeholder — `screen=Home`, `screen=Map`, … — under the
 * best-ranked of them. The palette used to list every one, so a query for a
 * screen name read as the exact event followed by eight look-alikes. Now the
 * representative carries a "+ N variants" count, and one row beneath it
 * expands the rest in place.
 *
 * The expand control is a cmdk item of its own rather than a button inside the
 * representative's row: cmdk keeps DOM focus in the search input and moves the
 * selection with the arrow keys, so a nested button would be reachable only by
 * Tab and would steal the representative's click. As an item it is arrowed to
 * and toggled with Enter like every other row.
 *
 * Being an `option`, it cannot carry `aria-expanded` (ARIA 1.2 allows it on
 * neither `option` nor anything nested in one; axe fails it as
 * aria-allowed-attr). The state is in its name instead — "Show 2 variants" /
 * "Hide 2 variants" — with `aria-controls` naming the members' group and
 * `data-expanded` for styling and tests. A name change on the active option is
 * not reliably re-read, so each toggle is also announced through a polite
 * status region. It is portalled to `<body>`: a listbox may own only options
 * and groups, so the region cannot sit inside the list.
