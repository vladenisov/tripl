 * upper bound to whenever the page happened to mount. The charts still refetch —
 * on the adaptive poll and on SSE invalidation — but they keep asking for that
 * same stale window, so buckets recorded after the page opened never appear on a
 * "live" chart no matter how long you leave it open (tripl-jfm3.114). It was
 * three separate copies of the same code: the monitoring detail page, the events
 * tab metrics card, and the per-row sparklines — whose memo had NO dependencies
 * at all, freezing the window for the whole life of the Events page.
 *
 * The bound advances in discrete steps so the query key is stable in between: a
 * continuously-moving `to` would mint a fresh cache entry on every render and
 * refetch in a loop.
