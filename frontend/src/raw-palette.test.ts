/**
 * Keeps raw Tailwind palette shades out of the UI (tripl-zgtu).
 *
 * A status chip written as `bg-amber-500/15 text-amber-700` has two problems
 * `src/theme-contrast.test.ts` cannot see, because that test only reads
 * `index.css`:
 *
 *  1. A light shade with no `dark:` twin. Measured on the tinted fill over the
 *     dark surface scale, `text-*-700` lands at 2.7–2.9:1 — below AA. Both
 *     halves have to be hand-maintained forever, and the dark half kept getting
 *     forgotten.
 *  2. The shade is picked by eye, so it drifts from the token scale silently.
 *
 * The tone tokens fix both: `--<tone>` is pinned as the AA-safe ink for its own
 * `--<tone>-soft` fill in *both* themes, so `bg-warning-soft text-warning`
 * needs no `dark:` variant and is covered by measurement. This test is what
 * makes that the only option on the table.
