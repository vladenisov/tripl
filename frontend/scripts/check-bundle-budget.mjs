// Fails the build when the JavaScript a first page load has to fetch grows past
// its budget, or when a chunk that is meant to load on demand ends up on that
// critical path. Reads what `vite build` wrote: the entry script and every
// modulepreload link in dist/index.html are what the browser fetches before
// the app can render anything.
//
// The budgets are a ratchet, not a target. Raise one only in the change that
// explains why the first load has to carry more; lower it when a change makes
// the first load smaller, so the saving cannot quietly be spent again.

// Bytes on disk before compression, measured 2026-09-25 plus ~5% headroom —
// after #194 took recharts, the demo chrome, the command palette dialog and the
// settings surfaces off the first load (entry 132 732, critical path 694 876).
// Raised for #195: the shell now carries the session-expiry sign-in dialog
// (eager on purpose — it exists to keep an unsaved page alive, so it must not
// depend on fetching a chunk after a deploy), the URL-synced branch context and
// the collapsed rail's controls (entry 145 128; the Appearance panel moved to
// its own chunk to pay for part of it).
// Critical path raised for React 19.3: react-dom's client build alone grew by
// ~31 KB minified, all of it in react-vendor, which every page needs (critical
// path 742 953 with the entry unchanged). Both lowered for tripl-fj5g.15: the
// demo scenario model loads only for demo projects and the alerting tab's
// sections load per tab (entry 127 029, critical path 724 527).
// Entry raised for the design-system follow-up (#198 / #206, frontend review
// r4): no new component code joined the first load — the entry grew by the
// lazy-route dependency map (`__vite__mapDeps`), which now names the shared
// on-demand chunks the refactor created (IconButton, the anchored combobox
// list, the kit form row used by the event forms, lib/format) in every lazy
// route that imports them (entry 134 119).
// Raised for the design review batches 5-12 (#237-#244): the shell now draws
// what used to be a blank screen or a page-level gap on first load: route
// skeletons shaped like each page (the Suspense fallbacks must be synchronous),
// the account menu in the sidebar footer, and the branch strip under the top
// bar. The activity rail moved out of the entry to pay for part of it
// (entry 145 367).
