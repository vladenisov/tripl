"""add search_documents.builder_version

Stamps each search document with the generation of the document builders that
produced it, so a builder change can be reconciled on branches nothing else
rebuilds (tripl-uji9).

Existing rows deliberately get 0 rather than the current version. They were
written by an older generation and the whole point is that the sweep should see
them: on the deployed database this is what makes the eight windy-ios working
branches — 7117 documents still built by the pre-keywords-fix code — visible for
repair. Backfilling them to the current version would declare the problem solved
without touching a single document.

The rebuild those branches then get is the ordinary incremental one, so a
document whose text is unchanged keeps its vector and its embedding and only has
its stamp corrected; nothing is re-embedded except what genuinely changed.
