"""add project-level app-version retention

Revision ID: 0f3a4b5c6d7e
Revises: f2a3b4c5d6e7
Create Date: 2026-07-13 20:45:00.000000

App-version retention is one project policy shared by event monitoring and
catalog metrics. Existing projects inherit the strictest configured scan value
(``MIN``), preserving windy-ios's current value of 3. The legacy scan column is
kept temporarily and mirrored for rolling-deploy compatibility.

Downgrade preserves the current project policy in every versioned scan; it
cannot reconstruct intentionally collapsed, formerly divergent scan values.

SQLite tests build the schema from ``Base.metadata.create_all``; this migration
only runs on PostgreSQL.
