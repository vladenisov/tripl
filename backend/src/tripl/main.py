# No `servers=` here, and none injected per request either — this instance never
# tells a client where it lives. An OpenAPI document with no `servers` defaults to
# `[{"url": "/"}]` resolved against the URL the document was fetched from (OpenAPI
# 3.1, OpenAPI Object), so generated clients and the /docs "Try it out" panel use the
# origin they already reached this instance on. That is right for every origin the
# instance answers on — public hostname, internal address, localhost in dev — and
# needs no configuration to stay right.
#
# The alternative, advertising `app_base_url`, shipped and then failed in
# production: the spec was served over https and advertised the plaintext internal
# address the deployment happened to have in APP_BASE_URL, so "Try it out" issued a
# cross-origin request the browser blocked as mixed content and CORS would have
# refused anyway — `Settings.cors_origins()` derives the allow-list from that same
# value, so a wrong `app_base_url` breaks both halves in the same direction
# (tripl-ouxw). Resolving it per request from the Settings -> Runtime override only
# made the wrong value correctable without a restart (tripl-mfqm); no single
# absolute URL is right for an instance reachable at several origins.
#
# It also keeps the served document identical to the committed backend/openapi.json
# that bin/dump-openapi.sh writes and test_openapi_contract pins, instead of a
# second, near-identical spelling of the same spec that only exists over HTTP.
# FastAPI's own /openapi.json handler adds the --root-path prefix and nothing else,
# and only when the app is mounted under one.

#   Starlette writes those above this entire stack, so unhandled_exception_handler
#   re-attaches the same headers itself from build_security_headers (tripl-qu9m).
# - CORS is innermost so preflight short-circuits don't need to traverse the

# - Brotli compresses the final response body (≥1KB), except the project SSE
#   stream where compression adds buffering risk to latency-sensitive chunks.
