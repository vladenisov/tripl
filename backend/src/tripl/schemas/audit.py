    with real audit history, ``/p/*/settings/audit`` had the slowest first
    content of the 75 routes in the 2026-08-17 walk. The payload now travels one

    Null and empty mean the write was not made through a branch-scoped request —
    main, or an action with no plan-branch dimension (alerting, scans, users) —
    so a reader must not render them as "main" (tripl-wkwv.6).
