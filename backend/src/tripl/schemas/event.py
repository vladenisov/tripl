# back as ProgramLimitExceeded ("index row size ... exceeds btree version 4
# maximum") — a 500 on the whole event save, for a payload that stored fine while
# the key was the two uuids alone (tripl-0zpq.255). The budget is in BYTES

    ``?tag=`` is an equality on ``event_tags.name``, so the stored spelling IS
    the lookup key and the documented rule ("free-form labels, lower-cased") had
    to hold on every door. It held on exactly one: the web form's own
    ``addTag``. Everything else — MCP ``create_event``, the bulk paste, a raw
    API client — stored what it was handed, so ``Checkout`` was invisible to
    ``?tag=checkout`` and sat beside it in the tag list as a second label.

    This fixes WRITES from here on; no migration rewrites the rows already
    stored. What reaches those is the other half of the same repair:
    ``event_service.list_events`` case-folds both sides of the ``?tag=``
    equality and ``event_service.list_tags`` lower-cases the facet, so a legacy
    ``Checkout`` row answers ``checkout`` and appears under it. A row keeps its
    old spelling in its own ``tags`` array until the event is next saved, which
    is cosmetic — nothing looks an event up by the spelling it carries.

    Two of the ways that went wrong were bare 500s. A repeated tag hit
    ``uq_event_tag`` at a flush no ``IntegrityError`` arm covers, and an
    over-long one overflowed ``String(100)`` in Postgres; both surfaced through
    the generic handler in ``main.py``. Deduping here means the constraint is
    never reached by a client that simply said the same thing twice. Length is
    REFUSED rather than truncated: two labels cut to the same 100 characters
    would then collide on that same key, turning a bad tag into a failed save
    of the whole event.
