# --- destination URL guards: shape here, reachability in the service ---------
#
# The two free-form destination URLs — a webhook's ``target_url`` and a Jira
# ``jira_base_url`` — are checked in TWO places, and the split is deliberate.
# Their SHAPE (present, https, no whitespace or control characters, trailing
# slash normalized) is a property of the string and is settled here, at parse
# time, so a malformed URL comes back as an ordinary field-level 422 naming the
# field. WHERE THEY POINT is settled in ``_alerting_destinations``, before the
# row is written.
#
# The public ``validate_webhook_target_url`` / ``validate_jira_base_url`` are
# these same two calls with ``block_private_hosts=True``, and that flag ends in
# ``reject_private_host`` -> ``socket.getaddrinfo``: a BLOCKING resolver call
# with no timeout of ours. A pydantic validator runs inside FastAPI's body
# parsing, which for an ``async def`` route happens ON THE EVENT LOOP — so
# saving a destination whose host resolved slowly stalled the entire uvicorn
# worker, and every unrelated request already in flight on it, for however long
# the resolver took (tripl-0zpq.30). That is why these wrappers exist and why
# neither of them may grow a ``block_private_hosts=True``.
#
# The SSRF guard is NOT weakened by the move, only relocated: it still runs on
# every create and every update before anything is stored, off the loop via
# ``asyncio.to_thread`` — the same offload ``_alerting_test_send`` already uses
# for the same guard. Send time keeps its own independent re-check
# (``alerts_channels._reject_private_target``); that one is the DNS-rebinding
# defence and belongs exactly where it is.
#
# Calling the private ``_validate_https_url`` is the point rather than an
# accident. The alternative is restating the https / emptiness / whitespace
# rules and their exact error sentences in this file, and two spellings of one
# rule drift apart. The field labels below are the SAME strings the public
# wrappers pass, so which half refused a URL cannot change the sentence the
# operator reads — ``tests/test_batch4_services.py`` compares the two messages
# and fails if they ever diverge.

def _validate_email_from_override(value: str | None) -> str | None:
    """The destination's optional From: override — None falls back to the global.

    Checked with ``validate_sender_address``, the SEND PATH's own helper, and
    NOT with the strict ``validate_email_address`` it used to reach through
    ``validate_email_from_address`` — a helper this change DELETED, because this
    was its last caller. Both places that resolve
    a From: at send time read this exact column —
    ``alerts._resolve_email_context`` for the immediate alert and the combined
    digest, ``alerts_channels._send_digest_to_destination`` for the weekly plan
    digest and the sunset alert — and both of them run the result through
    ``validate_sender_address`` and hand the ORIGINAL string to ``msg["From"]``.
    The destination's own Test button does the same (``_alerting_test_send``
    reads ``destination.email_from_address`` straight into ``_TestTarget``).

    So ``Tripl Alerts <no-reply@example.com>`` on a destination delivers, and
    delivers with the display name intact — the strict helper here was refusing
    a value every consumer of the column already accepts (tripl-v422). That is
    the inverse of tripl-0zpq.29 at the other end of the same pipe: there the
    diagnostics were more permissive than delivery, here the SAVE was stricter
    than delivery. Both mislead the operator about a configuration they cannot
    otherwise inspect, and both are fixed by the columns' readers and writers
    answering the question the same way.

    The global ``EmailSettingsUpdate.smtp_from_address`` — the value this one
    overrides — has been checked this way since tripl-0zpq.29. A value whose
    SHAPE was accepted globally and then refused on the destination that
    overrides it was the last asymmetry of that kind left in the pair.

    An asymmetry of a different kind remains, and it is about storage rather
    than validation: the global lives in ``app_settings.value``, a JSON
    document, so it genuinely has no width, while this override is a
    ``String(255)`` column. That matters here because dropping the strict helper
    dropped a length bound with it — ``validate_email_address`` normalises
    through ``email_validator``, which refuses an address over 254 octets, while
    ``validate_sender_address`` parses the address out of the value and hands
    back the WHOLE original string, display name and surrounding whitespace
    included. Neither of those is an address, so neither was ever capped. The
    two fields that call this helper therefore carry an explicit
    ``max_length=255`` of their own; without it a long organisation display name
    is accepted here and then fails in the INSERT, the 500 naming no field that
    ``AlertRuleBase.name`` describes (tripl-0zpq.275). The bound belongs on the
    fields and not in this function: the send paths that share
    ``validate_sender_address`` read a column this wide or wider, or none at all.

    What is still refused is a string with no @-sign in it. ``validate_email_address``
    behind ``parseaddr`` sees to that, and it is the one thing worth catching:
    it serialises into the header happily and comes back from the relay hours
    later as an error naming nothing.

    None and whitespace stay None, exactly as before — that is how the override
    is CLEARED, and an empty override is the supported state that falls back to
    ``settings.smtp_from_address``.

        This was the last surface emitting the raw placeholder.
        ``alert_templates.percent_delta_of`` answers 0.0 where
        ``expected_count`` is 0 because the ratio is undefined and the column it
        normally lands in is NOT NULL, and every other outbound encoding already
        NAMES that rather than printing it: the delivery's typed ``items[]``
        (``AlertDeliveryItemResponse``), the inbox card
        (``AlertInboxGroupResponse``), ``payload_snapshot`` and the webhook body
        all route through ``percent_delta_or_none``. The replay did not, so one
        incident answered "how big was this move" with ``null`` on the delivery
        it produced and with ``0.0`` on the simulate response that predicted it,
        and a consumer testing ``percent_delta > threshold`` read "no change"
        for the loudest class of firing there is — a scope firing from nothing,
        or resuming after an outage (tripl-0zpq.272).

        A SERIALIZER, not the ``@model_validator(mode="after")`` idiom the two
        sibling responses use, and the difference is not stylistic. Those two are
        response-only models. This one is ALSO the DTO two non-API consumers
        read, and both need a real float:
        ``alerting_rendering.render_firing_item`` formats it with
        ``f"{firing.percent_delta:.1f}"`` to fill the documented bare-number
        ``${percent_delta}`` template variable, and
        ``demo.builders.alerts._delivery_item`` copies it into
        ``AlertDeliveryItem.percent_delta``, which is NOT NULL. A validator fires
        at CONSTRUCTION, so it would hand ``None`` to both — and the renderer
        runs inside ``simulate_rule`` itself, meaning the preview would crash for
        precisely the zero-baseline firings this fix exists for. Nulling the
        ENCODING leaves the attribute alone: only the JSON changes.

        The ``float | None`` return annotation is load-bearing, not decoration.
        FastAPI builds a response model's OpenAPI from pydantic's SERIALIZATION
        schema, which takes the field's type from here; drop it and the body goes
        ``null`` while the published contract still promises a number.
