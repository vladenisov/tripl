"""Read-side response models for catalog-metric (MetricDefinition) series.

These mirror the event-metric shapes in ``schemas.event_metric`` but carry a
float ``value`` instead of an integer ``count`` — a catalog metric can be a
ratio or average, not just a count — and reuse the shared ``ForecastPoint`` /
``MetricSignalResponse`` / ``AppVersionInfo`` models so the frontend renders a
metric series with the same chart primitives it already uses for events.
