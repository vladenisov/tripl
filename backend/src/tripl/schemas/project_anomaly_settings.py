    """Reject a settling allowance that reaches the open-signal window.

    A bucket is withheld from SCORING for ``anomaly_ingestion_settling_minutes``
    and then counts as an open signal for ``recent_signal_window_hours``. Once
    the allowance reaches the window, the newest anomaly the detector may emit is
    born older than the window on every grid the window governs (any interval
    with ``3 x interval <= window``, where the freshness floor in
    ``services.monitoring_utils._freshness_horizon`` does not bind), so the
    Anomalies page, the sidebar badge and the Overview stat all read zero — while
    alerting, which classifies against the settled head, keeps delivering. That
    silent disagreement is the thing being refused; ``tripl-l429.15``.

    REFUSED, not clamped: both numbers are operator-set, so clamping would
    silently rewrite whichever one was touched last and make the stored result
    depend on edit order. A 422 names both values and lets the operator pick.

    Deliberately interval-independent, and therefore slightly over-strict: a
    project whose scans are all daily has a freshness horizon of 72h and would
    survive a 24h allowance under a 24h window. Consulting the scan intervals
    would make the settings valid or invalid depending on scan rows that can
    change afterwards, with no re-validation hook — a stable rule that reads only
    the two settings is worth the occasional false refusal, and "score a day late
    but call a signal stale after a day" is incoherent on its own terms.

    Returns the operator-facing message, or ``None`` when the pair is coherent.
