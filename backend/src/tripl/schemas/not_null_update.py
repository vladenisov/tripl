"""Refuse an explicit ``null`` on a PATCH field that maps to a NOT NULL column.

Every partial-update schema in this package spells its fields ``X | None =
None`` so that ``model_dump(exclude_unset=True)`` can tell "not sent" from
"sent". That ``| None`` is a wire convention, not a statement about the column:
a client that sends ``{"status": null}`` gets past validation, the service
``setattr``s ``None`` onto a NOT NULL column, and the commit raises
``IntegrityError``, which the unhandled-exception handler renders as a blank 500
(tripl-0zpq.181). An unset field never reaches a validator at all, so rejecting
``None`` at the boundary costs the honest client nothing and turns the 500 into
a 422 that names the field.

Only fields whose column is genuinely NOT NULL belong in a caller's frozenset —
``owner_id`` is nullable on purpose (an explicit null unassigns the owner) and
must stay out of it.
