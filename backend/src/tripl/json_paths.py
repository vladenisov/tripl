    """Rebuild a warehouse value as JSON-native data, all the way down.

    Adapters hand back raw driver values and a container hides them from every
    top-level type check: a ClickHouse ``Array(DateTime)`` arrives as a list of
    ``datetime``, a ``Map(Date, String)`` as a dict with ``date`` keys, a
    BigQuery ``STRUCT<ARRAY<TIMESTAMP>>`` as nested lists. Anything that then
    reaches ``json.dumps`` — this module's renderer below, or SQLAlchemy
    serialising a preview payload into ``ScanPreviewJob.result_summary`` —
    raised ``TypeError`` and the operator was told "Scan failed due to an
    internal error."

    ``json.dumps(..., default=str)`` is the obvious cheaper fix and it does not
    work: ``default`` is consulted for values only, never for dict KEYS, so a
    ``Map(Date, String)`` keeps raising. Rebuilding the tree covers both halves
    with one rule.

    Keys become ``str``. For int and finite float keys that is byte-identical
    to the coercion ``json.dumps`` already applied; what changes is their ORDER
    under ``sort_keys=True`` (``"1", "10", "2"`` rather than ``1, 2, 10``), and
    that ordering is NOT confined to display text. :func:`format_json_path_value`
    below is what ``catalog_sync._formatted_samples`` renders into the strings a
    variable context stores (``VariableValue.values``), what
    ``event_plan.raw_values_from_row`` feeds into the kwargs an event name is
    built from — and that name is the ``Event.source_name`` a series is filed
    under — and what a preview payload keeps as a path's sample values in
    ``ScanPreviewJob.result_summary``. A reordering here is therefore a change to
    stored data, and through the name format a change to event identity.

    No reachable input is known to move today: every container we have traced to
    that renderer is decoded from JSON text (``decode_json_path_value``'s
    ``json.loads``, or a ``toJSONString`` column), so its keys are strings
    already and sorting them changes nothing. That is a precondition, not a
    guarantee — nothing enforces it, and a driver-native mapping with non-string
    keys (the ``Map(Date, String)`` above) reaching the renderer would re-order
    one and mint a new identity from it. In exchange ``sort_keys=True`` stops
    being a second latent ``TypeError``: keys of mixed types are not orderable.
