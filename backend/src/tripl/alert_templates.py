# interrupted; a digest is twenty-four things that happened since yesterday and
# the reader is triaging over coffee. The verbose default answers the first
# question well and the second one badly: measured on a real production
# delivery it spends 317 characters per item, 186 of them on a raw details URL
# printed on its own line, so 24 items is ~8,150 characters of mostly URL.
#
# These templates are used ONLY when the delivery is a digest AND the operator
# has not saved a template of their own. A custom template always wins, and the
# immediate path never sees these at all.

# ── ${scope_label} and ${drift_line}: one wording, two renderers ───────────
#
# Two code paths render an alert item and they must word it identically. The
# worker renders a DELIVERED ``AlertDeliveryItem``
# (``alerts_messages._build_item_template_context``); the rule simulator
# renders a SIMULATED ``SimulatedRuleFiring``
# (``alerting_rendering.render_firing_item``), and the simulator exists so an
# operator can read what a rule WOULD send before pointing it at a live
# channel. Each used to build these two strings itself and the copies drifted:
# for one schema drift the worker wrote "drift: type_changed amount
# sample=9.99" where the preview wrote "drift: type_changed: amount — e.g.
# 9.99", so a rule tested in the simulator and then sent for real described the
# same firing two different ways (tripl-0zpq.165). The label map had split the
# same way — only the worker's knew about release regressions.
#
# The WORKER's wording is the one kept in both cases. It is the text an
# operator actually receives, it is what website/docs/use/alerting.md
# ("Release-regression items") quotes, and adopting it moves only future
# previews; adopting the preview's would have rewritten production message text
# on every channel and every already-stored payload snapshot would disagree
# with the next send.
#
# The scope constants below come from ``MetricScopeType`` rather than from
# ``tripl.alerting_matching``: this module is the leaf that both the worker and
# the services layer import, and it stays below the matcher.

    applied to the NEW release's own volume over the rollout-overlap window —
    so it is not a count of the same thing as ``actual`` and the ``%`` beside
    it is already ``1 - share_new/share_prev``, i.e. the share-for-share drop.
    Printed bare, the pair reads as "the count halved", and the first reply is
    "so what, the release only just rolled out" — an objection the
    normalization has already priced in, because a smaller adopting cohort
    shrinks ``total_new`` and shrinks ``expected`` with it.

    So the line states that the expectation was built FROM the new release's
    own volume. That single fact is what kills the misreading; the window is
    corroboration. Costs ~117 UTF-16 units over the old line, well inside the
    per-item budget that keeps a full 8-item Telegram delivery in one message.

    Public because the AI-explanation prompt quotes the same clause it renders
