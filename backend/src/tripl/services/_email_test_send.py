"""Send one probe message using the instance's own SMTP settings.

There was already a test send, but it hangs off an alert DESTINATION
(``_alerting_test_send``) and can only exercise one that has been saved. An
operator configuring SMTP so password-reset links go out has no destination and
never will — so the one path whose failure is invisible was also the one with no
way to check itself: ``request_password_reset`` returns the same neutral message
either way, and the background send swallows whatever goes wrong (tripl-wmpe).

Deliberately blocking, like every other channel client here. The caller hands it
to ``asyncio.to_thread``.
