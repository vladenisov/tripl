    the second half of the question: the scope has stored nothing newer than the
    anomaly, so it has emitted nothing since. This adds the facts that turn that
    into "still down":

      * the ANCHOR ROW says the scope was at zero when it was announced
        (``actual_count == 0``). ``_collapse_outage_runs`` gives an outage
        exactly one such row and never re-emits it, so this row is the whole
        announcement — there will not be a fresher one to age against;
      * the SCAN is still collecting something (``scan_latest_bucket`` inside
        the same freshness horizon), so the silence belongs to this scope rather
        than to a collector that stopped. Without it the very cap the
        latest-scan branch exists for would be gone, and a switched-off scan
        would pin its final anomaly red forever;
      * and the anchor row says there was something to LOSE
        (``expected_count > 0``). A scope that was expected to emit nothing and
        emitted nothing is not an incident, and it is the one shape this
        predicate alone can end: an empty scope stores no metric row, so its own
        head stays frozen AT the anchor and the latest-scan branch above is true
        for it forever. Production carried 14 such rows — "spike, 0 actual vs 0
        expected", written by ``_detect_trend_shift`` on a project running
        ``min_expected_count = 0`` — open since the day they were detected,
        invisible below the magnitude gate but permanently inflating the
        denominator the Anomalies page states out loud (tripl-wkwv.4).

    The three inputs are deliberately NOT symmetrical in how ``None`` is read.
    The first two are evidence FOR an outage, so an unanswered one cannot prove
    it and returns False. ``anomaly_expected_count`` is a DISQUALIFIER, so an
    unanswered one cannot disqualify and is ignored: a caller that supplies the
    pair but not the expectation keeps exactly today's answer instead of quietly
    closing an incident that is still running — the regression tripl-l429.15/.26
    fixed, and by far the more expensive of the two ways to be wrong here. Every
    caller that can answer it should, and all of them do.

    Callers that cannot answer the pair — catalog ``metric`` scopes have no scan
    to ask, and a fractional series' 0.0 is a value rather than "emitted nothing"
    — pass neither and land exactly where they did before. COUNT-shaped,

    worker's alert-candidacy pass in ``worker.tasks.metrics.signals``. It used to
    be two hand-maintained copies, on the stated grounds that the worker must not
    import the services layer; this module imports no ``tripl`` module at all, so
    that never applied, and the copies drifted twice inside one PR
    (tripl-l429.14, tripl-l429.19), each time showing a signal open on the page
    while the alerting path treated it as closed.

    The optional inputs below are the ones only some callers can answer, and each
    defaults to the value that reproduces the behaviour of a caller that cannot:

    * ``emission_lag`` — how far behind the metric head the newest EMITTABLE
      anomaly can sit. Detection withholds the newest ``settling_buckets`` of a
      series from emission, so a scope that is still emitting can never carry an
      anomaly at or after its own head; the alert path measures the head that far
      back so a live scope can reach the latest-scan branch at all. It is exactly
      a shift of the head, i.e. ``emission_lag=L`` answers what
      ``latest_metric_bucket - L`` would. The display path passes nothing, keeping
      the raw head and the classification the API has always rendered;
    * ``anomaly_actual_count`` / ``scan_latest_bucket`` — the outage re-check, see
      ``_outage_is_still_running``. Callers that cannot answer both (a catalog
      metric has no scan to probe, and a fractional series' ``0.0`` is a value
      rather than silence) pass neither and land where they did before;
    * ``anomaly_expected_count`` — the third input to that same re-check, and the
      only one whose ``None`` means "ignore" rather than "cannot conclude". Every
      caller that passes the pair above should pass this too; the polarity is
