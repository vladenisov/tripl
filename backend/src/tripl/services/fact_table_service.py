      time when it no longer resolves;
    * dropping or renaming an introspected column — metrics store the NAME of the
      column they aggregate, break down by, or filter on, and ``_fact_conditions``
      rejects it against ``allowed_columns`` at collection time. A re-preview
      against a query that no longer projects the column sends exactly this
      PATCH;
    * unbinding the data source — ``metric_collect`` raises "FactTable ... has no
      data source bound" for every metric on the table.

    ``exclude_unset`` is what makes the two list arms safe to write this way: a
    PATCH that does not mention ``row_filters`` (or ``columns``) has no key here
    and cannot trip the guard, while an explicit ``[]`` does, because removing all
    of them is exactly the destructive case. Same for ``data_source_id``: the key
    is present only when the client actually sent it, so ``None`` here always
    means "unbind", never "left alone".

    The dependents query runs only when one of those three keys is present AND
    something was actually dropped, so an ordinary rename of ``display_name`` —
    or a re-preview that only ADDS a column — still costs nothing.
