# both renderers and asserts the two whole items are equal.
#
# It is spelled twice only because the leaf both renderers already share —
# ``alert_templates``, where ``NO_BASELINE_LABEL`` lives for exactly this reason
# — is owned by another lane in this batch. Hoisting it there, beside a shared

    """The simulated firing's half of the ``${drift_line}`` contract.

    Twin of ``worker.tasks.alerts_messages._drift_facts``, which fills the same
    fields off a delivered ``AlertDeliveryItem``. Keeping these two adapters the
    only production constructors is what stops the preview's wording and the
    send's from splitting again (tripl-0zpq.165).

    ``window_from`` rides along like every other fact. It used to be the one
    field a firing could not supply — the replay loaded only stored anomaly
    rows, which record a bucket and no window — but a ``ReleaseRegression`` IS a
    stored row and it records both ends, and since tripl-0zpq.158 the replay
    loads it. THREE hops carry it from that row to here and all three are
    load-bearing: ``_load_release_regression_candidates``'s
    ``DriftAlertCandidate(window_from=...)``, ``simulate_rule``'s
    ``SimulatedRuleFiring(window_from=...)``, and this line. With all three the
    rollout-overlap clause renders in the preview exactly as it does in the
    send; break any one and it drops out of the PREVIEW alone, silently,
    because ``alert_templates._format_window_span`` is written to return None
    rather than to fail. Every other family still leaves it None, which is what
    that drop-out branch is for — and what an item delivered before the column
    existed still relies on.
