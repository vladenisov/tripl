    The THIRD door to the tripl-lpin outage, after the drift-accept in
    ``schema_drift_service`` and the plan-UI delete in ``field_service``. A merge
    that drops a FieldDefinition from main is the same ``session.delete(field)``
    with the same consequence: ``generate_events`` builds its format arguments
    only from columns that still have one, so every collection then dies on "the
    event name format references unknown keys" (tripl-3mmh).

    **Refusing the whole merge**, with a message naming every offending field, is
    the shape chosen over two alternatives:

    * *Refuse only that deletion and report it in the merge result.* It would
      silently diverge main from the branch that was just declared merged — main
      keeps a field the branch says is gone — and every later three-way merge
      compares against a base that never describes that state. There is also
      nowhere to report it: the merge returns ``PlanBranchDetailResponse``, so
      this needs a new response field and a new UI to read it, i.e. a fourth
      shape for one warning.
    * *Surface it through the merge-conflict machinery.* ``_detect_merge_conflicts``
      is a pure three-way payload diff and ``GET /branches/{id}/conflicts`` renders
      ``ConflictEntity{name, fields:[{field, base, ours, theirs}]}``. A scan-config
      dependency has no base/ours/theirs values and is not a divergence between two
      sides at all — it is an external constraint that would hold even if both
      sides agreed. Forcing it in means either fabricating those three values or
      inventing the fourth shape anyway.

    Blocking a large merge on one field is the cost, and it is the cost every
    other gate in ``merge_branch`` already charges (insufficient approvals, a
    stale base, an unresolved field conflict). The repair is one edit to the
    scan's Event name format, and then the merge goes through untouched.

    The discussion is not plan content (tripl-h2sx.25): no snapshot carries it,
    so no arm above sees it, and the deep copy leaves it on main's row, where a
    branch copy reads and writes it through its twin. What sits on a BRANCH row
    is only what had no twin to go to — the thread of an event created on the
    branch, the note typed with it at creation included, or one started before
    main grew a row for that identity. The merge used to leave all of it there:
    main's new row opened with an empty thread, the branch row then read through
    to that empty twin, and deleting the merged branch took the rows with it
    through the cascade (tripl-0zpq.122).

    None of it was ever copied from main, so all of it is the branch's own and
    there is no base to merge three ways against — unlike the photo threads
    above. The rows are MOVED, not copied: ids, replies and resolution state go
    unchanged, beside whatever thread the target row already had. The target is
    the twin the branch row already reads its discussion through
    (``_event_thread_twins``), where every thread started since that twin
    appeared already hangs; only a row that had none goes to the main row the
    merge lands its key on, created or matched.

    A branch row that lands nowhere — main deleted the event, or its event type,
    after the cut — keeps its thread: main's deletion stands, as it does for the
    photo threads, and this discussion goes with the branch. So does a row with
    no twin whose type and name several events share, on main or on the branch:
    the key cannot say which of them the thread is about, and the caller does
    not guess. An event the merge itself deletes from main takes main's thread

    # about one identity, the flush raises and ``_commit_merged_plan`` turns that
    # into a 409 that loses nothing.
    #
    # Deleting first would make that collision succeed instead, which is worse
    # than it sounds. Base and main both hold ``a``/S1 and ``b``/S2; the branch
    # deletes ``b`` and renames ``a`` to ``b``. ``pair_renames`` proposes a -> b

    # no rename is applied. Removing first would then delete main's ``a`` with
    # its ``variable_values``, ``variable_value_drifts`` and
    # ``variable_event_value_overrides``, and the upsert would write S1 onto
    # main's surviving ``b``: the row the user KEPT gone with all its observed
    # values and drift triage, the row the user DELETED left wearing the kept
    # row's scan identity, and the next scan matching warehouse data onto the
    # wrong history. Nothing in ``build_plan_snapshot`` would show it.
    #
    # A merge that genuinely wants both — the deletion and the move onto the
    # freed name — is ambiguous, and 409 asking the user to rename the clashing
    # entity is the honest answer. Cycles do NOT rely on this order: the parking
