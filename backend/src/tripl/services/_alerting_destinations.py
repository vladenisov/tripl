    the create and the update path, so a URL the guard refuses is never stored,

    this right. The import is deferred for the reason it is deferred there:

                # * NOT NULL — a digest this destination already sent reported
                #   this scope, and ``alerts._stamp_rule_state`` runs for a
                #   digest send exactly as it does for an immediate one. The
                #   gate then requires BOTH a strictly newer bucket and an
                #   elapsed cooldown, and neither holds at the moment of the
                #   switch: ``last_anomaly_bucket`` is advanced on buffered
                #   collections too, and ``cooldown_minutes`` defaults to 1440.
                #   The immediate path will NOT re-offer these rows, so they are
                #   KEPT and the drain arm delivers them on its next tick — it
                #   beats every 60s against a 300s collection, and it is the one
                #   path that ships a buffered row as it was buffered.
                #
                # The second case is the common one, not a corner, because a
                # state row carries no DIRECTION while a buffered row does: a
                # held DROP sits on the state row an unrelated SPIKE stamped,
                # carrying its own ``correlation_group_id`` and its own Inbox
                # card, and nothing re-offers it. Discarding it destroys an
                # incident that was never delivered and leaves the scope silent
                # for up to ``cooldown_minutes`` — the undeliverable-sibling
                # trap ``dispatch._buffer_pending_items`` argues in full, and
                # the one the drain arm refuses to filter on this same column to
                # avoid.

                # Only on cadence -> NULL. A cadence CHANGE (daily -> hourly)

                # clock fresh, so what is held is delivered on the new schedule
