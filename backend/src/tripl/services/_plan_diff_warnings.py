"""Row-level warnings on a branch diff that are not differences.

A diff says what changed between the base and the branch. It cannot say that
an ADDED event is broken in a way the merge will not fix — and on production
that was the case for every event authored on a branch before the naming rule
reached branches (tripl-kjhi.1): no ``source_name``, a free-text ``name``, and
a merge that would land a row the scan can never match. The reviewer approving
the branch is the last person who can catch it, so the diff tells them.
