"""Declarative demo scenario: recipe contract, context, and orchestrator.

The demo is a *versioned recipe*: an ordered set of focused builders that each
seed one slice of a project. ``DemoContext`` carries the identity
(``project_id``/``branch_id``/``slug``), the clock (``now``), the determinism
``seed``, and the stable semantic references (name -> id maps) that later builders
read instead of threading ORM objects between modules.

The orchestrator never commits — the caller (``demo_service.create_demo_project``)
owns the transaction boundary, so a mid-seed failure rolls the whole seed back.

# variable-value drift is seeded on product_id (Trial Started).
