"""Alerts builder: a local, no-network alerting scenario over the demo signals.

Seeds a demo-only ``demo_sink`` destination (a local sink that renders and
records deliveries with no outbound network), a FIRING alert rule driven by the
real seeded anomalies (project-total / event-type / event / catalog-metric
scopes, plus the schema / distribution / variable-value / release-regression
opt-ins) and a HEALTHY quiet rule, their per-scope ``AlertRuleState`` rows, one
locally-delivered ``AlertDelivery`` + items with rendered template output, an
inbox correlation group, and a chart annotation explaining the injected spike.

Everything is produced with ZERO network side effects: the delivery text is
rendered via the same pure renderer the in-UI simulator uses
(``render_firings_message``) and recorded with a local/simulated marker, so
Monitors, the inbox, delivery history, retry and simulate are all fully
explorable in a demo without any credentials. The builder runs AFTER monitoring
and catalog so the anomalies/metrics it references already exist; like the other
builders it only ``flush``es (the caller owns the single transaction) and never
calls a service that commits internally.

        # Nothing the demo seeds overflows 255 today: ``_resolve_scope_name``

        # name, or the scope ref, and the seeder writes all of them. But it reads
        # them back out of the DB by id, so its inputs are ``Event.name``
