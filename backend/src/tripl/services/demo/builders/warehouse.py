"""Warehouse builder: the synthetic scan surface and its metric series.

Seeds the (never-queried) DataSource scoped to the demo project, a ScanConfig,
the per-event and per-type ``EventMetric`` series, and the ``EventMetricBreakdown``
platform split. Volumes come from the deterministic :mod:`demo.noise` helpers, so
the shape is reproducible for a given ``(clock, seed)``.

Shares series with the monitoring builder through the context (``home_series`` and
``type_bucket_counts``) so the real detector runs over exactly the stored counts.
