"""Audit builder: the change trail behind everything the recipe just authored.

The demo seeder writes plan objects directly rather than through the audited
service paths, so a fresh demo landed on "No audit entries yet" — a dead end on
a surface the product calls a headline governance record and the Concepts
glossary describes as "a chronological record of who changed what in the plan"
(tripl-jfm3.60).

This builder backfills that record from what the recipe REALLY created: it reads
the ids the earlier builders published on the context (and the alerting rows they
inserted) and emits one entry per authored object, attributed to the demo's
creator and back-dated so the log reads as a plausible build-up rather than a
single timestamp. Every action string a PROJECT-scoped row uses is one the Audit
tab's filter offers, so the seeded trail is filterable out of the box; the one
instance-scoped row (``data_source.create``) carries no project, which is how its
real route records it, and is therefore no more and no less visible than a real
one (tripl-wkwv.15).

EVENTS were missing from that list until tripl-wkwv.14, and not by choice: when
this builder was written the events router recorded nothing at all, so there was
no vocabulary to seed. tripl-wkwv.10 gave events one and made the Events group
the FIRST thing the filter offers — and on a demo holding eighteen events it
matched nothing, implying nobody had ever created an event on a project whose
whole point is to look lived-in.

THREE RULES THE EVENT ROWS FOLLOW, each of them a way of not lying:

1. Every row is DERIVED from a row some earlier builder really wrote. Creations
   are dated from each event's own ``created_at`` — the same column the detail
   page reads "first seen" from — and edits are read back from the ``EventChange``
   history the activity builder seeded. Nothing here invents a subject.
2. One audit row per REQUEST, not per changed field. A PATCH writes one audit row
   and one ``EventChange`` per TRACKED field it changed (four of them —
   ``event_service._TRACKED_FIELDS``), so the edits are grouped by (event,
   instant) before becoming rows; two fields changed together stay one row, as
   they would in production.
3. No bulk and no delete rows. The recipe never bulk-edited or deleted anything,
   so ``event.bulk_*`` and ``event.delete`` match nothing — truthfully. A reader
   who wants to see one can perform the action in the demo and watch its row
   appear, which is exactly what the demo docs promise about their own actions.

Runs after every builder that creates an object it records, which is tenth of
eleven — the search reindex follows it. It only records what already exists, and
never invents an object.
