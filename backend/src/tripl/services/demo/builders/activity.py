"""Activity builder: edit history and external design specs.

Seeds the ``created`` first row of every authored event plus a small, realistic
``EventChange`` edit history (both reachable via
``/events/{id}/history``) and one ``EventPhoto`` of kind ``figma`` that embeds an
external design URL with no stored bytes — the no-secret embed path, so the demo
needs no storage backend. Both are reachable through the events API.

The history is also what the audit builder derives the demo's ``event.update``
rows from, so the two surfaces cannot disagree about an edit they both describe.
That is why the retirements below live HERE rather than being invented there: a
real PATCH writes both surfaces, and an audit row for an edit with no history
behind it would be a shape production never produces.
