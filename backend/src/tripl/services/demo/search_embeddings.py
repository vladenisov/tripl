"""Keyless semantic search for the demo project.

The demo's searchable text is fully deterministic, so its embeddings can be
precomputed once (by a maintainer running
``scripts/generate_demo_search_embeddings.py`` with a real OpenAI key) and
shipped as a compressed ``.npz`` fixture. At demo (re)index time the fixture
vectors are stamped onto matching search documents; at query time a small set
of canned query vectors stands in for the live embedding call. No API key is
ever needed at runtime.

The fixture keys documents by ``sha256(embed_text)`` — NOT by ``content_hash``,
which mixes in the per-install random demo slug and entity ids and is therefore
not install-stable.

Identity fallback (bd tripl-jfm3.8)
-----------------------------------
Keying by embed text alone is fragile: the demo runs the REAL scan/collection
pipeline, and that pipeline rewrites the very text the key is derived from
(observed field values replace ``${product_id}`` templates, catalog sync appends
auto-created field descriptors, variable contexts are re-recorded). One scan —
step 1 of the coached "Run the live loop" chapter — therefore missed every key
and left the whole index ``embedding_status='disabled'`` with no provider to
re-embed it, so semantic search died permanently on the demo's own showcase
query.

So each vector also carries a CONTENT-INDEPENDENT identity key,
``entity_type \x1f title \x1f subtitle``, in the JSON sidecar next to the
archive. A document whose descriptive text a scan has changed still resolves to
the vector generated for that same entity. The sidecar is derived, not embedded:
regenerate it by rebuilding a pristine demo, computing
``embed_text_key(embed_text_for(...))`` per search document and mapping the
identity key onto it — no embedding API call is involved.
