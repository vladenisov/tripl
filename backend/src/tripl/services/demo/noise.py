"""Deterministic shape helpers for the demo scenario.

Pure functions only — no DB, no I/O. Every value the demo seeds is derived from
``(clock, seed)`` through these helpers, so re-running the recipe with the same
clock and seed produces an identical data shape.

Determinism note: per-series noise is derived with :func:`derive_seed` (SHA-256)
rather than the Python builtin ``hash()``. ``hash()`` is salted per-process for
``str``/``bytes`` (PYTHONHASHSEED), so keying noise off ``hash(str)`` would make
the seeded metrics/anomalies/drift non-reproducible across runs.
