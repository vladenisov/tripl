"""Which alembic revision this instance's database is actually stamped with.

The deployment is safe by construction — compose runs a ``migrate`` one-shot and
the app waits on ``service_completed_successfully`` — but that is an INFERENCE
drawn from the compose file, not an observation of the database. A
constraint-only migration changes nothing a probe can see, so a hand-rolled
deploy that skipped ``alembic upgrade head`` looked exactly like a correct one
(tripl-wkwv.7).

Every read here degrades to an honest unknown instead of raising, in the spirit
of ``apply_startup_service_overrides``: this backs the owner-only System panel,
and the settings page must never 500 because a revision could not be read.
