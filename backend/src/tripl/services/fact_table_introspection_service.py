"""Introspect a fact-table SQL: bucketed columns and identifier candidates.

This powers the FactTable create/edit "Preview columns" surface. Given a
project, a data source, and a read-only ``SELECT``, it opens a warehouse
adapter, asks it for the query's output columns (warehouse type names), then
returns:

* ``columns`` with each warehouse type bucketed to one of
  ``number`` / ``string`` / ``bool`` / ``timestamp``, and
* ``identifier_candidates`` (string-typed columns whose name or declared
  warehouse type carries an identifier signal — see
  :func:`is_identifier_column` — excluding the timestamp column).

It reads the query's SHAPE and never its rows. The response used to carry up
to twenty raw warehouse rows as ``sample_rows``, which nothing in the product
displayed; see :func:`_run_introspection`.

Scope: a data source is global in this schema, and which project may use it is
decided by OWNERSHIP — see ``services/data_source_scope``, whose rule this door
shares with the fact-table save door and both ``sql``-metric doors. The
introspection refuses any data source that is identifiably another project's.

Security: the SQL is re-validated as a safe read-only ``SELECT`` before any
warehouse call (defense in depth — the request schemas validate it too), and the
adapter runs it as a bounded, read-only subquery with its own identifier-allowlist
/ literal-escaping. This module adds no other SQL string handling; beyond that it
only buckets type names and coerces scalars.
