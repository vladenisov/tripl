"""Test send — prove a destination actually reaches its channel.

"bot token set" and "chat -100..." say a value is STORED, not that anything
arrives: a revoked token, a webhook whose channel was archived and a healthy
destination all render identically in the form (tripl-oxkt.17). This module
sends one fixed, clearly-marked message through the destination's real channel
so the two can be told apart.

No ``AlertDelivery`` row is written for a test. That is a deliberate choice
rather than a shortcut: ``AlertDelivery.rule_id`` and ``.scan_config_id`` are
both NOT NULL, so a test row could only exist by borrowing a real rule and a
real scan and claiming they fired — which is precisely the lie the Delivery log
must not tell, and it would also stamp ``AlertRuleState.last_notified_at`` and
silence the next genuine alert through that rule's cooldown. The operator action
is recorded where operator actions belong, in the audit log, by the route.

The actual sending goes through ``worker.tasks.alerts``' channel wrappers — the
same functions ``send_alert_delivery`` calls — so a destination that passes here
passes for the same reasons a real delivery would, and there is only one place
where a channel's request shape is defined.
