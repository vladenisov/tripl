"""Retire the variables a scan minted and nothing ever referenced (danger zone).

The predicate lives in :mod:`tripl.core.variable_retirement` and is shared with
the scan worker, which runs the same pass at the end of every run so a catalog
stops accumulating fossils in the first place. This module is the operator's
door to it: one deliberate, owner-only, audited pass over a whole project, for
the backlog that built up before the worker started sweeping — 1296 rows on the
project this was written for.

Shaped on :mod:`tripl.services.detection_reset_service`, the other danger-zone
service: bulk statements with ``synchronize_session=False``, commit, return
counts, idempotent on a second call.

``dry_run`` is the default and it is not decoration. The counts it returns are
broken down by *why* each row was kept, so an operator sees "1280 retirable, 18
kept because a live event still names them, 219 kept because a human edited
them" before anything is deleted.
