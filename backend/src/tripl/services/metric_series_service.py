"""Read service for catalog-metric (MetricDefinition) series.

Loads ``MetricValue`` rows for a definition, densifies them onto the interval
grid, joins anomaly flags, and attaches a one-step forecast — returning a
payload shaped like the event-metric series but with float values. Breakdown
and app-version variants mirror the event equivalents.

Reuse, not duplication: the densify-to-grid primitive (``expand_series``), the
forecast (``forecast_next_buckets``), the anomaly→signal mapping
(``_signal_from_anomaly``) and the signal-state classifier
(``classify_signal_state``) are all imported, not reimplemented. Only the
float/no-event-scope shaping is specialised here.

ANOMALY-SCOPE (ticket tripl-dxhp.6): catalog-metric anomalies are stored in
``MetricAnomaly`` under ``scope_type='metric'`` /
``scope_ref=str(metric_definition_id)`` with a NULL ``scan_config_id``. The read
filters on BOTH ``scope_type == MetricScopeType.metric`` and the scope_ref so it
can never pick up an unrelated row whose scope_ref happens to equal a metric
definition UUID.

GRID-POPULATION (ticket tripl-0zpq.115): one chart must describe ONE population.
An anomaly row carries no ``scan_config_id``, so the band it draws is whatever
the detector scored; the value line therefore has to be read the way the
detector reads it — SUMMED per bucket over every source config on the metric's
resolved grid interval (:func:`_grid_population_filter`, mirrored by
``detect._metric_grid_population``). Reading a single config plots one addend of
the band around it; reading every config mixes intervals that are not addable.

    The population is every source config collecting this metric ON THE

    reduction the detector scores (``detect._load_metric_value_points``), so the
    line a chart draws and the ``expected_count`` / ``stddev`` band drawn around
    it describe one series. A ``MetricAnomaly`` row carries no
    ``scan_config_id``, so there is no narrower population it could be matched
    against.

    NOT the single resolved config: an ``event_composition`` metric stores one
    value series per source scan (``metric_collect._compose_grid_region`` writes
    a row set per config that collected the numerator) and ``MetricValue``'s
    unique key is ``(metric_definition_id, scan_config_id, bucket)``, so two
    LIVE configs may legally hold the same bucket — one event type collected by
    an iOS scan and an Android scan is the ordinary shape. Filtering to one of
    them plots an ADDEND of the band around it, and ``metric_grid_stmt`` picks
    that one with an ``ORDER BY bucket DESC`` tie-break that is undefined
    between two equally-current configs, so which addend could also flap.

    NOT every config either: two grids of DIFFERENT intervals are not addable (a
    1h count and a 1d count are not the same unit), and mixing them anchored
    ``expand_series`` on the OLDEST grid's first bucket, which dropped the live
    grid's values and invented zeros in their place. The interval is the line
    between "another source of this series" and "a retired grid".

    ``scan_config_id is None`` means the metric is ``sql``/``fact``: those rows
    are written with a NULL ``scan_config_id`` exclusively, so the IS NULL
    branch is exact rather than merely narrower and the interval never enters.

    KNOWN OPEN (tripl-0zpq.115 follow-up): two configs scanning the SAME
    warehouse rows on the same interval are summed, i.e. double-counted. Nothing
    stored tells them apart from two configs covering disjoint traffic, so the
    read cannot decide it — that is a collection-side question, and this
    predicate deliberately matches the detector rather than guessing differently
    from it.
