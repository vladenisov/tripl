"""Shared release-activation logic.

A release is "active" only once it takes a real share of user traffic. This is
what separates a shipped release from a dev/tester build that surfaces with a
higher SemVer but negligible traffic. Both the release-regression analyzer
(``tripl.core.analyzers.release_regression``) and the app-version series
selection (``tripl.services.metrics_service``) build on these primitives so
there is a single definition of "active".

Pure functions only — no database or warehouse access — so the logic stays
unit-testable. Buckets are ``datetime`` timestamps throughout.
