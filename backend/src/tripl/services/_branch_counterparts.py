"""A branch event's twin on main, and what the branch borrows from it.

A working branch deep-copies every event under a NEW id (``deep_copy_plan_to_branch``),
and everything that arrives from a warehouse — ``event_metrics`` rows,
``last_seen_at`` bumps, anomalies — lands on the MAIN row, because scans only
ever see main. So a branch copy of a live event read "never seen, no volume"
on every page, and an analyst on a branch could not tell a dead event from a
busy one (tripl-kjhi.9).

A branch copy's twin is the main row it was copied from (``origin_id``,
tripl-0zpq.292). Only a row without one — created on the branch — or a copy
whose origin main has since deleted pairs the old way: same event type NAME
(a branch type has its own id too), and the same scan identity —
``source_name`` where the row has one, ``name`` where it does not, on both
sides. Nothing is written back; the branch row only reads through to its twin.
