"""Pair two sides of a plan row by row: origin id first, natural key second.

Events and relations carry no uniqueness on the natural key the branch diff,
merge, conflict scan and revert used to pair them by — (event type, name) and
the four names a relation links — so two rows can share it (namesakes). Keyed
one row per key, every one of those paths collapsed a pair to whichever row was
listed last: a deleted namesake stayed on main after the merge, an edit to one
landed on the other, and the batch-2 attempt to pair by content found 21 more
ways to guess wrong (tripl-0zpq.149, tripl-0zpq.292).

A branch copy now records the main row it was made from (``origin_id``), and a
main row IS its own origin, so two sides pair exactly when one of them names
the other's ids: ``ref_of_new`` answers with the origin id for a branch copy and
the row's own id for a main row, and ``id_of_old`` with the id the old side
recorded (a stored base snapshot records main's ids). The natural key is the
fallback, and only for rows the ids do not place: a row authored on the branch,
or a branch opened before origin ids whose namesakes the migration could not
tell apart. Even then a key is paired only when it holds exactly one unplaced
row on each side. Several are ``ambiguous`` — unless the caller knows the new
side records every origin it has (``unplaced_are_new``): then an unplaced old
row is one the new side deleted and an unplaced new row one it created, and
nothing is left to guess.

Pure: no I/O, no ORM, so the diff (snapshot dicts), the conflict scan and the
merge (ORM rows) share one definition of "the same row".
