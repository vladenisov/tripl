"""Update a plan branch from main: a three-way merge of main INTO the branch (PL-8).

Before this, a branch opened a minute before an unrelated edit to main read
"behind" for the rest of its life, and the only advice the product had was
"recreate the branch" — redo the work. The update brings main's changes onto
the branch instead, and asks the user to pick a value only where both sides
changed the same field: keep the branch's (``theirs``) or take main's
(``ours``). Afterwards the branch's base IS main, so the branch diff shows the
branch's own work and nothing else, and the next merge has nothing to refuse.

What overlaps and what gets written comes from ``_plan_branch_three_way``,
which the conflicts endpoint reads too, so the list the user resolves is the
list the update applies. The writes themselves reuse the revert's snapshot
writers (``plan_branch_revert_service``): the revert writes the base's state
onto branch rows, the update writes main's.

One transaction, in the merge's lock order — the branch FOR UPDATE, then main
— so a merge or a plan write racing the update either lands first and is seen,
or waits. Nothing is written unless every conflict has a choice.
