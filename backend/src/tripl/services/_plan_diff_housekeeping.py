"""Diff entries that are the machine's doing, not the author's.

A branch diff is read by a reviewer deciding whether to merge, and every row
in it reads as "the author did this". Two kinds of removal are not that. A scan
mints a variable for every JSON key it meets, including keys typed by users —
on production a branch with two authored events showed seven removed variables
named after cities, all "Auto-detected variable from data source scan", none
bound, documented or referenced (tripl-kjhi.12). And a removal main has ALSO
made since the branch was cut is nothing the merge will do. Both are tagged
here with a reason, kept out of the headline counts, and folded into one line
by the UI; the entries themselves stay in the response, so nothing is hidden.
