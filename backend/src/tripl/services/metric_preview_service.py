"""Stateless dry-run previews for draft catalog metrics.

Two flavours, one purpose: the metric's SQL is EXECUTED against the selected
warehouse while the editor is open, so a query that would otherwise only fail
inside a Celery worker — where nobody is watching — can fail here instead, in
front of the person writing it.

Preview is an OFFER, not a gate. Nothing in the save path calls it and the form
does not require it, so "it previewed" is never a precondition for 201 and
"it did not" is never a refusal. Whatever the save path must guarantee it has to
check for itself: the projection rule the collector enforces lives in
``SqlConfig`` on the schema boundary, not here (tripl-0zpq.173). Preview's job is
the half a schema cannot do — actually running the statement against the real
warehouse.

* ``preview_sql_metric`` runs a user-authored ``sql``-kind SELECT through the
  SAME safety gate (``validate_select_sql``) and time-window wrapping
  (``get_preview_rows``) the worker's ``_collect_sql`` uses, plus the dialect lint
  (``lint_dialect_sql``). The save path runs the same lint on new or changed SQL
  and refuses with the same message (tripl-0zpq.371); the worker's collection
  does not call it (tripl-0zpq.355).
* ``preview_fact_operand`` compiles a draft ``fact`` operand's row filter with
  the worker's OWN ``_resolve_fact_operand_query`` (fed the very config dict a
  save would persist) and executes the result, bounded to one row.
* ``preview_metric_series`` is the series dry run for the two kinds that have
  no SELECT of their own (MT-9): a ``fact`` draft runs the collector's own
  ``_aggregate_fact_window`` per operand over the last closed buckets
  (``fact_series_preview_window``), and an ``event_composition`` draft
  composes the already-collected event counts of one scan grid with the
  collector's ``evaluate_composition``.

None of them persists anything. Expected user mistakes — bad SQL, an unknown named
filter, a measure column the filtered query does not project, a warehouse
rejection — come back as a 200 payload with ``error`` set so the editor can
render them inline; only auth, unknown project, unknown fact table and unknown
data source use 4xx.

    inside a Celery worker, long after the user saved and walked away. This closes
    that — the same dry-run contract the ``sql`` kind already had.

    Divergence is designed out rather than tested for. The request body IS a
    :class:`FactOperand`, so ``to_config()`` produces the exact dict a save would
    persist; that dict is parsed by the worker's own ``_operand_from_config`` and

    column is then checked against the columns the filtered query actually
    returned, exactly as ``_aggregate_fact_window`` does before aggregating.
