"""Stateless dry-run previews for draft catalog metrics.

Two flavours, one rule: the metric's SQL is EXECUTED against the selected
warehouse before it can be saved, so a query that only fails inside a Celery
worker — where nobody is watching — fails here instead, in the editor.

* ``preview_sql_metric`` runs a user-authored ``sql``-kind SELECT through the
  SAME safety gate (``validate_select_sql``), dialect lint (``lint_dialect_sql``)
  and time-window wrapping (``get_preview_rows``) the worker's ``_collect_sql``
  uses.
* ``preview_fact_operand`` compiles a draft ``fact`` operand's row filter with
  the worker's OWN ``_resolve_fact_operand_query`` (fed the very config dict a
  save would persist) and executes the result, bounded to one row.

Neither persists anything. Expected user mistakes — bad SQL, an unknown named
filter, a measure column the filtered query does not project, a warehouse
rejection — come back as a 200 payload with ``error`` set so the editor can
render them inline; only auth, unknown project, unknown fact table and unknown
data source use 4xx.
