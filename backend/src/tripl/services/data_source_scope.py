"""Which data sources a project may point at — one rule, every door.

Four request doors ask this question: a ``sql`` metric's save and preview
(``metric_definition_service.load_project_data_source``) and a fact table's save
and preview (``fact_table_service._verify_data_source`` and
``fact_table_introspection_service._load_project_data_source``). Until this
module they answered it differently — the metric doors asked who OWNS the
source, the fact-table doors asked whether a ``ScanConfig`` binds it to this
project — and a user in the fact-table wizard could meet both verdicts for one
id inside a single flow (tripl-0zpq.177, tripl-0zpq.353).

OWNERSHIP is the rule that survived, because the binding rule is unworkable on
the metric doors: a ``sql`` metric needs no scan at all (``check_metric_
definitions_due`` selects active metrics with no ``ScanConfig`` join), creating
a scan config is owner-only so there is no way for an owner to bless a
metrics-only warehouse, and the check re-runs on every definition update — so a
colour-only PATCH would 404 because the form resends the stored data source with
it. What ownership costs the fact-table doors is written down in
:func:`data_source_out_of_project_scope`.

# The one sentence all four doors refuse with, at one status (404). It names the
# real cause instead of claiming the row is missing: the older "Data source not
# found" was justified as anti-enumeration, but ``GET /api/v1/data-sources``
# hands every authenticated user the whole workspace inventory (id, name,
# db_type, project_id; only the connection fields are redacted) and
# ``GET /api/v1/data-sources/{id}`` separates 200 from 404 for any UUID — so the
# only person the vague message fenced was the legitimate editor, sent hunting
# for a row that exists (tripl-0zpq.354).
#
# The wording stays UNIFORM across "no such row" and "out of scope", which is the
# half that does buy something: a project-scoped API key is refused on those
# slug-less data-source routes (``api.deps``), so for that caller distinct
# messages here would be the one way to tell a non-existent id from another
# project's source.

    """Whether ``data_source`` is identifiably ANOTHER project's warehouse.

    A pure function of three facts, so that the sync collector can apply the
    identical verdict to an ALREADY-STORED ``data_source_id`` without importing
    the async request path (tripl-0zpq.347). One rule, every caller: a predicate
    that drifts between save, preview and collect is the shape of the defect
    this came from.

    A data source is refused when it is:

    * owned by a different project — ``project_id`` set to someone else, the
      demo case, where that column exists precisely to scope a synthetic
      warehouse to one workspace;
    * workspace-global (``project_id`` NULL) but scanned by some other project
      and not by this one — an owner pointed it at that project, and an editor
      here should not borrow its credential.

    ``scanning_project_ids`` is every project with a ``ScanConfig`` bound to this
    source. It is consulted only for a workspace-global source, where it is the
    sole evidence of a claim; for an owned source the column decides, and the
    caller may pass an empty set rather than query (see
    :func:`scanning_project_ids_for`).

    WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY ALLOWS, and did not before on the fact-table doors: a
    workspace-global source that NO project scans is reachable from every
    project. That is what the NULL means — shared — and it is the configuration
    an owner creates for a warehouse that is queried but never scanned. So is a
    source owned by this project with no ``ScanConfig`` yet. In the other
    direction the rule is stricter than the binding rule it replaced: a source
    OWNED by project Z stays refused here even if this project happens to scan
    it, where "has a ScanConfig in this project" would have let it through.
