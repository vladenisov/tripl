    ``commit`` exists for the one caller that writes a BATCH of rows for a single
    user action: the inbox bulk route files one row per incident, and committing
    inside that loop made a 200-incident mute 200 separate transactions, any of
    which could fail after the earlier ones were already durable — leaving
    incidents silenced with no record of who silenced them. Passing
    ``commit=False`` and committing once after the loop makes the batch atomic
    (tripl-gpfr).

    It defaults to True because every other caller writes exactly one row and
    relies on this function to land it; flipping that default would silently
    leave audit rows uncommitted across the whole API.

    ``target_name`` is truncated to the column width — see ``_TARGET_NAME_MAX``
    for why that is a guard and not a formality.

    The branch is NOT a parameter. It is read off the request-scoped contextvar
    that ``api.deps.get_branch_id_override`` — the one function that resolves
    ``?branch=`` — binds, so EVERY branch-scoped route handler records it
    without a single call-site edit and the next one cannot forget to
    (tripl-wkwv.6). Deliberately not a census: this sentence used to say "all 21
    ... and the 22nd", which was already off by one when it was written and is
    off by six now that the six event routes record. Universal quantification is
    what the mechanism guarantees, and it cannot go stale.
    A NULL ``branch_id`` with an empty ``branch_name`` means "not written through
    a branch-scoped request": either main, or an action with no plan-branch
    dimension at all (alerting, scans, data sources, users, API keys). It does
    not assert "main", which is why the audit tab shows a chip only when
    ``branch_name`` is non-empty.
