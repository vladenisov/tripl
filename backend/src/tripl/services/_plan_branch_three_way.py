"""Base, main and one branch lined up entity by entity, for "Update from main" (PL-8).

The merge reads the three sides in one direction: what the BRANCH changed since
the base goes onto main. "Update from main" reads them in the other: what MAIN
changed since the base comes onto the branch, and where both sides changed the
same field the user picks the value to keep. This module is the pure half of
that — snapshot dicts in, conflict rows and write operations out — so the
conflicts endpoint, the update preview and the update itself share one answer
to "what overlaps" and "what would be written".

Identity is the merge's own (design §1):

* event types, fields and meta fields by name — the name is the identity;
* variables by ``source_name`` where one side carries it, else by name, so a
  rename on either side is one row, not a removal beside an addition;
* events and relations by id: main's rows by their own ids, which the base
  recorded, the branch's by ``origin_id`` (``pair_rows``, as ``merge_slots``).

``ours`` is main and ``theirs`` the branch throughout, as in the merge engine,
and a stored resolution names the value to END with: ``ours`` takes main's,
``theirs`` keeps the branch's.

Pure: no I/O and no ORM, so every rule here can be tested without a database.
