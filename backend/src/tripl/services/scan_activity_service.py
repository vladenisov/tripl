"""Per-scan run activity for the Scans list, aggregated in SQL (tripl-fj5g.11).

The list used to derive three figures from a capped page of each scan's jobs —
the last run, the current failing streak, and the rows read in the last 24 hours
— so a scan that ran more often than the page held showed the streak and the
24h total as floors ("failed last 10+ runs", "1.2M+"). Loading every job to make
them exact is what tripl-jfm3.107 capped in the first place, so each figure is
one grouped query here instead, over every scan config in the project at once.
