"""Line up base, main and branch rows for the merge, one slot per row.

The merge used to upsert events and relations by natural key, one row per key
on each side: with two main rows sharing (type, name) — namesakes, which nothing
forbids — a main row was deleted only when its KEY vanished from the branch, so
deleting one namesake on the branch left both on main, and each branch copy's
edits landed on whichever main namesake the dict kept (tripl-0zpq.149). Every
arm that followed a row through that map inherited the guess: the variable
overrides, the successor pointer, the order, the photos and the discussion
(tripl-0zpq.292).

A slot is one base row with its main counterpart (paired by main's own id,
which the base recorded) and its branch counterpart (paired by the copy's
``origin_id``). The natural key is the fallback, only for rows the ids do not
place — see ``_origin_pairing``. Rows the base never had are matched across the
two sides by key when exactly one of each is there (both sides added the same
thing, which the conflict scan has already judged), and otherwise the branch's
are created.

Pure, like ``pair_rows`` and ``pair_renames``: the caller is the merge engine,
where a wrongly matched id cannot be taken back.
