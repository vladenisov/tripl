"""Row locks on ``plan_branches`` that serialise plan writes against a merge.

One mechanism for three merge-time races (tripl-0zpq.288, .290 and .294): the
``plan_branches`` row of the branch a write lands on is the lock for that
branch's plan.

* A plan write takes its branch's row ``FOR SHARE`` in the request's own
  transaction and holds it until that transaction ends. Writes to one branch
  share the lock, so they never wait for each other.
* A merge already takes the merged branch's row ``FOR UPDATE``
  (``plan_branch_merge_service._lock_branch_for_merge``) and now also takes
  MAIN's row ``FOR NO KEY UPDATE`` (:func:`lock_main_plan_for_merge`) before it
  reads main for the conflict check, holding both to its commit.

``FOR SHARE`` conflicts with both of the merge's locks, so every plan write is
ordered wholly before or wholly after a merge of its branch or into main: a
write that arrives mid-merge waits for the merge to commit and then re-reads the
row (PostgreSQL returns the newest committed version to a locking read at READ
COMMITTED), sees ``merged`` and is refused — or, on main, applies on top of the
merged plan; a merge that arrives mid-write waits for the write to commit and
then snapshots a plan that includes it.

Why main's lock is ``FOR NO KEY UPDATE`` and not ``FOR UPDATE``: every insert of
a main-scoped row (an event, a type, a variable) takes ``FOR KEY SHARE`` on
main's row for its foreign key, and that is compatible with ``NO KEY UPDATE``
but not with ``UPDATE``. So a scan inserting events on main in a worker is not
queued behind a merge it has nothing to do with; only the writes that took the
explicit ``FOR SHARE`` are.

DEADLOCK AUDIT (tripl-0zpq.288). Two ``FOR SHARE`` holders that both go on to
UPDATE the same row deadlock. No write path that takes this lock updates the
``plan_branches`` row: the rows it is written from are the transition route
(status), the merge (status, ``merged_*``) and branch deletion, and none of
them resolves its branch through ``?branch=``, the comment path or the photo
path. The merge, which does update the row, takes ``FOR UPDATE`` up front
rather than ``FOR SHARE`` and upgrading. Anything new that wants to change a
branch row inside a plan write must take ``FOR UPDATE`` there instead.

Lock order: a merge locks its branch, then main. A plan write takes exactly one
of these rows. A write that held main's row and then needed a WORKING branch's
row for a foreign key while a merge of that branch waited on main would
deadlock. No plan write found in the audit inserts rows pointing at a branch
other than its own, and PostgreSQL would abort one side with 40P01 rather than
hang if one ever did.

PostgreSQL only, like ``_lock_branch_for_merge`` and
``demo_runtime._acquire_project_xact_lock``: SQLite (the unit suite) has one
writer at a time and no row locks, so the lock clause is left off there. The
row is still read afresh, so callers see the same row either way.
