"""Keep a branch event's discussion when the row it hangs on goes away.

A branch row holds a thread of its own only when it had no main twin to anchor
on at the time — an event created on the branch, or a question asked before a
scan (or an author) gave main a row for that identity. Once that twin exists,
``event_comment_service.event_thread`` reads both anchors, so the discussion is
visible from either side. Deleting the branch row then took its half through
the ``event_photo_comments`` FK cascade, although the twin that shows it is
still there (tripl-0zpq.289).

The merge already moves these threads onto main (tripl-0zpq.122). Every other
door that deletes a branch event — the event delete and bulk delete, the event
type delete that cascades its events, the revert of an ``added`` entity, and
deleting the branch itself — runs ``rescue_branch_event_threads`` first, with
the same UPDATE the merge uses (``move_event_threads``).
