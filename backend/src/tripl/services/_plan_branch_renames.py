    """Match main's rows to the branch rows they were renamed into.

    Each mapping is one side's natural key -> that row's ``source_name``.
    Returns ``old_key -> new_key`` for every pair proven to be a single row the
    branch renamed, so the caller can UPDATE main's row instead of replacing it.

    ``_apply_merge`` upserts by natural key, and for an Event that key contains
    the very name the user edited — Event has no ``display_name``, so its
    machine name IS the displayed one and editing it is routine. Left unpaired,
    a rename reads as a removal plus an unrelated addition: main's row is
    deleted, a fresh uuid inserted, the FK cascade takes
    ``variable_values.event_id``, their drift rows and ``event_changes`` with
    it, and the ``event_metrics`` series is left holding a NULL ``event_id``.
    None of those are in ``build_plan_snapshot``, so no diff shows the loss and
    no arm of the merge carries them across. Photos cascade as well but do not
    belong on that list — they are snapshotted and the merge has an arm that
    re-creates them — and alerting holds no FK to an event at all; what makes
    the losses above worth a rename is that nothing sees them go.

    ``source_name`` is what survives a rename, and that is the repo's own rule
    rather than a marker invented here: ``update_event`` and ``update_variable``
    write ``name`` and never touch it, ``create_event`` stamps it from the
    generated name because scan dedup keys on it, the Event model declares it
    the stable scan identity, and ``deep_copy_plan_to_branch`` carries it onto
    the branch copy so a branch row still answers to main's identity.

    So the pairing reads the identity directly on both sides and never the name
    key sets. That is the whole of tripl-htcz: derived from the key sets, a
    rename was only visible when its name VANISHED from the branch, and in a
    cycle no name vanishes. A plain swap — A renamed to B while B is renamed to
    A, reachable through a temporary name — left both sets empty and paired
    nothing, and a longer rotation put mismatched rows in them. The upsert then
    matched each branch row to the main row wearing its new name and wrote that
    row's ``source_name`` onto it, which for a Variable is a non-deferrable
    ``UNIQUE (project_id, branch_id, source_name)`` violated inside one flush.

    A pair is still made only when the identity is unambiguous, and the shapes
    that must keep merging as a delete plus an insert still do:

    * **No source_name**, or **two or more candidates on one side** — see
      ``_sole_key_by_identity``, which drops both. On main "one side" means the
      rows that were there when the branch was cut, not every row main holds
      now; the comment on the narrowing below says why.
    * **An identity only one side carries.** A genuinely added row and a
      genuinely removed one, which must keep merging as an add and a removal.
    * **A row main never had at the base.** A rename moves a row that existed
      when the branch was cut; anything else is main's own edit racing the
      branch's, which conflict detection judges rather than this.
    * **A move onto a name a STAYING main row still holds.** The branch renamed
      A to B while main independently grew its own B: honouring the rename would
      put two rows on one name. Dropping one such move can strand another that
      was only legal because its destination was being vacated, so the check
      repeats until it stops finding any.

    The key type is the caller's own, not widened to ``NaturalKey``, so the
    result can be used to re-key the very maps it was derived from — with
    ``rekey_in_place``, because the result may now be a permutation.

    Pure by construction — three plain mappings in, one mapping out — because
    the caller is the merge engine, where a wrongly matched id is unrecoverable,
    and every case above therefore deserves a test that needs no database.

    A branch diff compares the base snapshot with the branch, and keys entities
    by name, so a rename arrives as a removal of the old name plus an addition of
    the new one — two rows that look like a deletion and an unrelated creation.
    The merge knows better, and this says what the merge knows, from the same
    ``pair_renames`` the merge itself calls (tripl-amnn). A second implementation
    would be free to drift, and the cost of drift here is a UI that promises a
    rename the merge then performs as a delete-plus-insert, cascading the
    variable's observed values and drift rows on the way through.

    Only pairs the diff actually SPLIT are returned. ``pair_renames`` also pairs
    a swap and a longer rotation, where every name is present on both sides and
    the diff shows two ``changed`` entries instead — there is no removal and no
    addition to join up, so reporting one would name entries that do not exist.
    Hence the two membership tests: a removal exists only for an old key absent
    from the branch, an addition only for a new key absent from the base.

    Three payloads and not two, because the merge's pairing reads main: a move
    onto a name a staying main row still holds is refused, and a row main grew
    after the branch was cut can never be a rename source. Passing the base twice
    would answer a question nobody asked and would promise pairings the merge
    would then refuse. Callers already hold all three — ``diff_branch`` builds
    the main and branch snapshots to compute the diff at all.

    The answer is as fresh as ``main_payload``: main can move between this call
    and the merge, and then the merge pairs what main says at that moment. That
    is the same staleness ``behind_base`` already reports, not a new one.
