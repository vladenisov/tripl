    a project that no longer exists should look like — while a create or rename
    row carries both.

    The name and slug are repeated into the payload deliberately. After a delete
    the id resolves to nothing, so the row has to be readable on its own; this is
    the same reason ``event.bulk_delete`` files names rather than ids alone.

    Takes the three values rather than the project: a delete row is written after
