    Deliberately NOT ``data.model_dump()``, the shape every other router uses:
    one ``EventFieldValueIn.value`` may be 100 000 characters and the list has no
    upper bound, and ``EventMetaValueIn.value`` is uncapped outright, so copying
    the body verbatim would put megabytes into a single ``audit_log.payload``.

    The two value lists are the whole target. ``description`` and ``tags`` are
    also uncapped and DO stay in the payload, because event_types.py and

    writer in the repo bloats one — a length cap for those belongs in
