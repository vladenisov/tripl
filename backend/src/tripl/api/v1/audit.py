# Owner-only: this feed was the back door around two other owner-only gates.
#
# Every entry carries the request payload that produced it — since tripl-5ydt on
# ``GET /audit/{entry_id}`` alone, not on every list row — and the router had
# nothing but the shared auth dependency, so any authenticated user could read:
#
#   * ``data_source.create`` / ``.update`` payloads — the warehouse host, port,
#     database and username that data_sources.py:69 deliberately BLANKS for
#     non-owners on every direct read of the same source;
#   * ``scan_config.create`` payloads — ``base_query``, the free-text SQL that
#     authoring a scan is owner-only to protect (api/v1/scans.py:36), since it
#     reads whatever the warehouse credential can.
#
# The log is also INSTANCE-wide — ``project_slug`` is a filter, not a scope — so
# the reach was every project, not just the caller's. Passwords were never
# exposed; audit_service._redact strips them (tripl-jfm3.110).
