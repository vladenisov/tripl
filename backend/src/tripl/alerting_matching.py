"""Pure rule/anomaly matching helpers shared by live and simulated paths.

The live alert pipeline (worker/tasks/metrics/dispatch.py) and the in-UI rule
simulator both apply the SAME predicates to anomalies — extracting them here
guarantees the simulator never diverges from production about WHICH signals a
rule admits.

That is the whole of the promise, and the limit is deliberate rather than an
omission. The predicate half is shared CODE: ``rule_matches_anomaly`` is the one
function both callers run, and it takes no destination because no destination
can change whether a signal matches. The RATE LIMITER is not shared —
``simulate_rule_firings`` below re-implements the live cooldown in memory — and
there is one destination class it gets wrong, because dispatch switches the
cooldown off for a destination carrying a ``delivery_schedule_cron`` (its
cadence is its rate limiter) and nothing in this module is handed a destination
to notice. The argument lives on ``simulate_rule_firings`` and on
``services.alerting_service.simulate_rule``, where the gate is actually applied,
so there is one copy of it to keep true rather than three.

These functions never touch the session and never mutate state.

    """Replay anomalies through a rule with in-memory cooldown gating.

    Returns the subset that would have triggered a delivery, in bucket order.

    Cooldown is applied per (scope_type, scope_ref, scan config) — the partition
    ``uq_alert_rule_state_scope`` gives AlertRuleState, which is the clock the
    live pipeline gates on for a destination that delivers IMMEDIATELY. (For one
    that does not, see the last two paragraphs: it gates on no clock at all.)
    Keying it on (scope_type, scope_ref) alone was ONE place this module's
    no-divergence promise was false
    (tripl-0zpq.42): ``dispatch._prepare_alert_deliveries`` runs once per scan
    config and loads only THAT config's states, while the replay hands a whole
    project's anomalies through in a single pass, and a rule is project-wide
    unless deliberately bound to one scan. An event that is anomalous in scan A
    at 09:00 and in scan B at 09:30 therefore has two live clocks and sends
    twice; the scan-blind key collapsed both onto one and reported a single
    firing, so the what-if under-counted the rule it was asked about. Which
    scopes this moves is decided by the scope_ref: ``event`` and ``event_type``
    refs are the bare entity id and genuinely repeat across configs, whereas
    ``project_total`` (the config id) and schema drift (the drift row id) are
    already partitioned inside the ref and are unaffected either way.

    ``metric`` is the deliberate exception and stays project-global: a catalog
    metric is not a per-scan series, so its live state carries NO scan config at
    all — ``AlertRuleState.scan_config_id`` is NULL for a metric scope, and a
    partial unique index over that NULL space is what gives it one clock per
    (rule, scope) for the whole project (tripl-0zpq.28). The branch below reads
    the scope rather than the candidate's ``scan_config_id`` anyway: metric
    candidates carry NULL there too, so the two agree, and keying on the scope
    says what the partition IS rather than what one candidate happens to hold.

    When ``cooldown_minutes_override`` is set, that value is used in place of
    ``rule.cooldown_minutes`` so the simulator can A/B different cooldowns
    without writing back to the rule.

    The two threshold overrides do the same for the numeric gates, and are
    forwarded whole to ``rule_matches_anomaly`` — the gate has to move INSIDE the
    replay, not after it, because a signal the stricter rule would never have
    matched must not consume the cooldown slot that then hides the next one.
    ``event_type_by_event_id`` is forwarded for exactly that reason too: a
    candidate the ``event_type`` filter rejects must not burn the cooldown slot.

    THE COOLDOWN IS THE IMMEDIATE PATH'S LIMITER AND THIS FUNCTION APPLIES IT TO
    EVERY REPLAY, INCLUDING ONES LIVE DOES NOT APPLY IT TO.
    ``dispatch._prepare_alert_deliveries`` computes ``cooldown_applies =
    destination.delivery_schedule_cron is None`` and both of its send gates read
    ``not cooldown_applies or _cooldown_elapsed(...)``, so a destination holding
    its alerts for a digest never consults ``cooldown_minutes`` at all. The clock
    is not absent — ``alert_digest_send`` runs ``alerts._stamp_rule_state`` for
    every member of a sent digest, exactly as the immediate path does, and a
    scope no digest has carried yet simply still holds NULL — it is just never
    read while the cadence is set. What limits that destination instead is the
    buffer's unique key ``uq_alert_pending_item_scope``: one row per
    (destination, rule, scan config, scope, direction), so a scope re-firing all
    day occupies one digest line per direction per cron window
    (``dispatch._buffer_pending_items``).

    This function is handed no destination and models no cron window, so for a
    cadence destination it answers the immediate-delivery question, and it is off
    in whichever direction the two periods differ: hourly digests under the
    default 1440-minute cooldown UNDER-count (one firing a day per scope against
    up to 24 digest lines), a daily digest under a 60-minute cooldown
    OVER-counts. Mirroring ``cooldown_applies`` here — just skipping the gate
    when a cadence is set — would be worse than either, because with no limiter
    every matched bucket becomes a firing (~2000 a week per scope at five-minute
    collections, against a digest that ships one line) and ``noisy`` would trip
    for every cadence destination in the deployment. A faithful mirror has to
    replay the cron windows (``core.alert_schedule``) and collapse per (scope,
    direction) inside each, which reports digest LINES rather than rule firings
    and leaves ``cooldown_minutes_override`` — the knob the replay dialog exists
    to A/B — with nothing to vary. That is a different feature, so the gap is
    stated here and on ``simulate_rule`` rather than half-closed.
