    """A threaded comment, anchored either on one attachment or on the event.

    One table for both because they are the same object: threaded, authored,
    plain text, and deliberately NOT plan content — no snapshot, no approval
    hash, no search index, nothing that reaches whoever implements the event.
    An event-anchored row is the discussion the analyst asked for ("not a
    Title and not a Description — it raises something"); a photo-anchored row
    is the same conversation pinned to one frame.

    Exactly one anchor is set. ``photo_id`` had to become nullable for that,
    which is also why every query meaning "the attachment threads" filters on
    ``photo_id`` rather than reading the whole table: an event thread must stay
    out of ``build_plan_snapshot``, out of the branch deep copy, and out of the
    merge carry-back.
