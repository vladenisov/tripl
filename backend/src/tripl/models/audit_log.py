        # over everything that matched (tripl-wkwv.20). All three are ASCENDING
        # though the query reads descending: a btree is scanned equally well in
        # either direction as long as EVERY sort column is reversed together,
        # which these are. And all three carry ``id``, because ``created_at``
        # alone is not a total order — ``server_default=now()`` gives every row of
        # one batch the same value, so the pager needs its tie-break inside the
        # index rather than in a sort on top of it (tripl-5ydt).

        # 1. One project's log, the common case. ``list_entries`` resolves the
        # slug to a project and matches the ID (tripl-wkwv.18), so the leading
        # column is ``project_id`` and not the slug. This also covers the
        # ``ON DELETE SET NULL`` cascade as a prefix: deleting any project scans
        # this table to null the column out, which is the argument that earned
        # ``branch_id`` its own index. Deliberately NOT claimed for the demo
        # reset's purge — that predicate ORs across two columns and the second
        # half is unindexed, so a scan is the honest expectation there.

        # to narrow it first.

        # ``create_all``-built test schemas hid (tripl-1iic). Do not restore it.
