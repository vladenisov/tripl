# ``scope_name`` is the human label an alert shows for the thing that fired.
# Three tables store one and all three declare it VARCHAR(255): this one,
# ``alert_pending_items`` and ``anomaly_scope_overrides``. Its sources are
# wider. ``Event.name`` is String(500) and ``schemas/event.py`` admits every
# character of it, while the drift scopes append ``.{field}`` to an event or
# event-type name and so overflow 255 even when the name alone does not.
#
# Untrimmed that is not cosmetic. Postgres rejects the INSERT with "value too
# long for type character varying(255)", and ``_prepare_alert_deliveries`` runs
# inside ``collect_metrics`` with no savepoint — so one long-named event rolled
# back the anomaly recalculation, the rule and cooldown state and every
# delivery for every scope of that scan config, and because the cooldown never
# committed the next tick failed identically for as long as the anomaly stayed
# active (tripl-0zpq.253). SQLite ignores VARCHAR(n) entirely, which is why the
# suite never saw it.
#
# Widening the three columns was the alternative and was rejected for the
# reason ``services/audit_service.py`` already records for this same bug one
# table over (tripl-wkwv.10): a migration whose downgrade has to truncate live
# rows, for a display-only field. Display-only is checkable here — nothing keys
# on the label. ``dispatch._correlation_group_id`` hashes the scope's PARTITION
# (its scan config, or a literal for a project-global metric scope) with
# rule:scope_type:scope_ref:direction, and the false-positive ratchet keys on
# ``(scan_config_id, scope_type, scope_ref)``.
#
# The guard lives on the model rather than beside a writer because the writers
# sit in two layers with no other way to share one: ``alert_payload`` under
# ``worker/``, and ``_event_generator_merge`` / ``_event_generator_merge_refs``
# under ``core/``, which may not import ``tripl.worker`` — a rule stated in
# ``_event_generator_merge_refs``'s module docstring, with
# ``MetricDefinition.mark_collection_error`` as the precedent for moving a
# helper down here to satisfy it. ``worker/tasks/metrics/urls._trim_alert_text``
# is the same three lines and deliberately stays where it is: it is the generic
# alert-text trimmer, defaulted to 500 and reachable only from the worker.

    # Two consequences a reader keeps guessing wrong:
    #
    # * It is set on EVERY item, not only on co-fired ones. The inbox lists an
    #   item only if it has one (``_alerting_deliveries._INBOX_GROUP_SELECT``
    #   filters ``is_not(None)``), so while a group meant "2+ peers" a solitary
    #   alert never reached the inbox and could not be acknowledged, muted or
    #   resolved at all — and solitary is the common case (tripl-jfm3.91).
    #   "Did this co-fire?" is therefore a peer COUNT within one delivery, which
    #   is what ``AlertDeliveryRow.buildCorrelationLabels`` counts before it
    #   letters a row, and never a test for this column being non-NULL.
    # * The bucket is deliberately absent from the key, so peers inside one
    #   group are the same scope over time rather than the scopes that fired
    #   together, and a group outlives the hour that opened it.
    #
    # Nullable only for history. Rows written before tripl-jfm3.91 carry none,
    # and ``_alerting_deliveries.list_deliveries(ungrouped=True)`` exists to
    # give them a section of their own rather than drop them silently. Nothing
    # writes NULL today: the buffered twin ``AlertPendingItem`` declares the
    # same column NOT NULL, and ``alert_flush`` copies it straight across onto
