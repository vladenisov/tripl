class AlertPendingItem(UUIDMixin, TimestampMixin, Base):
    """One alert held back, waiting for its destination's next digest window.

    A destination with ``delivery_schedule_cron`` set does not deliver after
    every metrics collection. Instead ``_prepare_alert_deliveries`` upserts the
    matched signals here, and ``flush_due_alert_digests`` turns the accumulated
    rows into ordinary ``AlertDelivery`` + ``AlertDeliveryItem`` rows when a
    cron boundary passes.

    Deliberately NOT a held ``AlertDelivery``. A delivery parked in ``pending``
    is swept and sent by ``requeue_stranded_alert_deliveries`` within 15
    minutes (worker/tasks/maintenance.py), so the feature would fail OPEN on a
    15-minute fuse; and a delivery is only ever born at flush time here, which
    keeps ``AlertDeliveryStatus``, the reaper's predicate, the Inbox, and the
    four ``created_at``-ordered read paths untouched.

    A row lives exactly as long as its destination's hold does, and leaves this
    table one of four ways: the flush CLAIMS it by DELETE in the transaction
    that mints its delivery; the 14-day sweep drops one whose cadence has
    stopped firing; disabling the destination discards the whole buffer; and so
    does clearing the destination's cadence, because "Immediately" has no window
    left to wait for and the immediate path delivers those scopes itself on the
    next collection (tripl-0zpq.38 — both paths delivering them is a double
    send, since a held scope's ``AlertRuleState.last_notified_at`` is still
    NULL). Nothing prunes a row merely because its scope fell quiet.

    Every value is SNAPSHOTTED rather than FK-referenced back to the anomaly
    that produced it, for the reason ``AlertDeliveryItem.window_from`` already
    documents: the source rows are deleted and rewritten on every scan, so a
    digest assembled a day later would find nothing.
