# 100 means "at least double, or at most half" — measured, not picked for the
# round number. Replaying 24 hours of live iOS collections through the repaired
# signal gate produced 436 items in 54 deliveries at 0 (a message every ~25
# minutes), 267/32 at 50, and 37/7 at 100 — the last on a par with the 16 items
# in 11 deliveries the instance actually sends today. What that volume is made
# of argues the same way: 435 of the 436 were single-bucket seasonal deviations
# rather than sustained level shifts, and 106 of 223 scopes fired in BOTH
# directions inside the same day.
#
# A scope going dark still passes: actual 0 against any positive expectation is
# exactly 100%, and the comparison is strict. That is the one class of volume
# alert that reaches anyone today.

    # destination off a project, and ``_prepare_alert_deliveries`` runs once per
    # scan config, so one rule fired for every scan there is. On the live
    # instance a single low-value legacy scan contributed 82% of the alert
    # stream and there was no way to exclude it — ``AlertRuleFilterField`` has

    # project-wide. A bare SET NULL is not enough on its own either, because a
    # rule narrowed to the noisiest scan would silently re-widen to the whole
    # project the moment that scan is deleted and start paging on every other
    # one. ``scan_service.delete_scan_config`` therefore also DISABLES the rules

    # Manual snooze for a monitor: while ``muted_until`` is in the future the

    # every rule ever created carries, and a rule has no status column to tell
    # "never muted" from "muted forever". Same shape as
    # ``AlertCorrelationState.muted_until`` but read the OPPOSITE way: on an
    # inbox incident a NULL is the INDEFINITE mute (tripl-a50u). The two checks
    # look alike and must not be unified — see
    # ``AlertInboxActionRequest.validate_action``.

    # Timed-only, and deliberately NOT like the inbox mute action this was
    # modelled on: ``MonitorMuteRequest.muted_until`` is required, non-null and
    # must be in the future, because accepting a null HERE would mute the whole
    # fleet at once. A rule's permanent lever is ``enabled``.
    #
    # The worker suppresses deliveries for a muted rule on BOTH delivery paths.
    # An older version of this comment called that "a separate follow-up", and
    # on the strength of it the Monitors UI shipped a Mute button that wrote
    # this column and changed nothing (tripl-jfm3.99). Today:
    # ``metrics.dispatch._prepare_alert_deliveries`` skips a muted rule BEFORE
    # it splits immediate destinations from scheduled ones, so a muted monitor
    # neither mints an ``AlertDelivery`` nor buffers an ``AlertPendingItem``;
    # ``alert_flush._build_digest`` re-checks when the digest is built, so a
    # mute set during a hold window drops the items already buffered along with
    # the claim instead of releasing them once the mute lapses.
    # ``alerts._assert_rule_still_active`` re-checks queued deliveries just
    # before outbound send, after rendering may have taken time. The rule's
    # open/close state is updated before the dispatch check, deliberately, so a
    # mute does not leave the monitor stuck "firing" on a stale scope. The
    # API-side predicate is ``_alerting_monitors.is_rule_muted``.
