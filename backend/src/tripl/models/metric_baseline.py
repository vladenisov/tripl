    """The band the detector judged one bucket of one scope against.

    ``metric_anomalies`` only holds FLAGGED buckets, so a chart could draw the
    expected value and band on those alone (tripl-i9mt.25). The metrics worker
    writes one row here for every bucket it scored — flagged or not — keyed like
    an anomaly row. Scan-scoped series only (``project_total``, ``event_type``,
    ``event``): catalog ``metric`` scopes chart through their own series and
    store nothing here yet.

    Not ``event_metrics`` columns: the project-total series is a SUM over the
    event-type rows and has no row of its own to carry a baseline.

    ``effective_stddev`` is the floored stddev the z-score divides by, so the
    band ``expected_count ± sigma_threshold * effective_stddev`` is exactly the
    detector's boundary: a point outside it is a point it would flag.
