"""Request-scoped plan-branch context for the audit writer.

``audit_service.record`` is called from every write route and must not grow a
``branch=`` argument in the branch-scoped ones — that is a standing invitation
for the next branch-scoped route to forget it, which is how tripl-wkwv.6 arrived
in the first place. Deliberately not a census: the counts this paragraph used to
carry were already wrong when they were written, and adding the six event routes
moved them again. ``?branch=`` is already resolved in exactly one place
(:func:`tripl.api.deps.get_branch_id_override`), so it is bound there and read in
exactly one place (:func:`tripl.services.audit_service.record`). Those two are
the only binder and the only reader; each names the other in a comment.

Unlike the request id, this value needs no ASGI-scope mirror. The hazard that
forced one on ``request_id`` — ServerErrorMiddleware serves the catch-all 500
handler from OUTSIDE RequestIDMiddleware, so the contextvar is already reset by
the time that handler runs (tripl-qu9m, see ``request_id._SCOPE_KEY``) — cannot
bite here: the audit row is written mid-handler, long before any unwinding, and
a request that never reaches its handler writes no audit row at all.

The reset in :func:`bound_branch` is load-bearing, not hygiene. Under uvicorn
each request cycle is its own task and therefore its own Context, so a leak
would be invisible in production; the test suite drives the app through
``httpx.ASGITransport`` (tests/conftest.py), which awaits the app in the
CALLER's task, so an unreset ``set()`` bleeds one request's branch into the next
request of the same test.
