"""The bucket grid a catalog metric is scored on — resolved in ONE place.

Every surface that classifies a ``metric``-scope signal has to measure it
against the metric's OWN grid: the freshness horizon is
``max(recent_window, 3 x interval)``, so a daily metric judged against a bare
24h window closes on the day it fires (see
``services.monitoring_utils._freshness_horizon``).

Where that grid is recorded depends on the kind:

* ``sql`` / ``fact`` metrics collect on their own ``MetricDefinition.interval``;
* ``event_composition`` metrics leave ``interval`` NULL and align onto a SOURCE
  SCAN's grid, which is recorded on the ``scan_config_id`` stamped on their
  stored ``MetricValue`` rows (NULL for the other two kinds).

A metric whose values were collected under more than one ``scan_config_id``
(e.g. after a source config was recreated) must resolve deterministically to the
grid currently in use, so the most-recent bucket's ``scan_config_id`` wins.

This module owns that rule so the request path (async) and the worker (sync)
cannot drift: three call sites had already grown their own answers — the sidebar
badge used no interval at all, the metrics/anomalies list paths used only the
metric's own column, and alert dispatch substituted whichever scan happened to
be dispatching (tripl-l429.17/.18/.22). It is a pure leaf (models + SQLAlchemy,
no service or worker imports) and hands back a statement rather than running it,
because only the caller knows whether its session is sync or async.
