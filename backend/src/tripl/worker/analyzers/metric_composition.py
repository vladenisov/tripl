"""Pure bucket-alignment / ratio evaluator for ``event_composition`` metrics.

No I/O: every function takes already-loaded per-bucket series (a mapping from a
bucket ``datetime`` to a numeric value) and returns NEW dictionaries. The
collection task in ``metric_collect`` loads the numerator/denominator series
from Postgres (event_metrics) or the warehouse (distinct users) and feeds them
here, so this module stays trivially unit-testable.

Composition semantics (per the metrics epic):

* ``single``            -- the numerator count per bucket.
* ``ratio``             -- numerator / denominator per bucket; a zero (or
  absent) denominator yields ``None`` (divide-by-zero), NEVER ``0`` and NEVER a
  silently dropped bucket. The bucket stays in the result mapped to ``None``.
* ``per_distinct_user`` -- numerator / per-bucket distinct-user count; identical
  arithmetic to ``ratio`` with the distinct-user series as the denominator.

Both ratio-style operators densify the two series onto the UNION of their
buckets first, so misaligned numerator/denominator grids line up: a bucket
present in only one series is treated as ``0`` in the other.

    This module is the one place two INDEPENDENTLY SOURCED series meet — the numerator

    from the warehouse right now — and the sources do not agree on tz-awareness:
    ClickHouse hands back naive bucket cells, PostgreSQL aware ones, and the app DB adds
    its own opinion (SQLite reads naive). Mixing them made ``sorted()`` in
    :func:`union_buckets` raise ``TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware
    datetimes``, so every ``per_distinct_user`` metric on a ClickHouse source failed
    collection outright (tripl-ju0d).

    Coercing one side alone only moves the crash: normalizing the warehouse series broke
    the stored series instead. Both sides are normalized here, at the junction, so no
    future series source can reintroduce it.

    Treating a naive bucket as UTC is not a guess — it is the contract in
    ``core/bucketing``, which every adapter's generated SQL is measured against.
