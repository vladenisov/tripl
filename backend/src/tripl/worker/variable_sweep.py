"""Retire the variables a project no longer refers to, at the end of a scan.

The scan is what mints variables, so the scan is where they should stop
accumulating. Without this the catalog only ever grows: production's
``windy-ios`` reached 1517 variables of which 1296 were referenced by nothing,
1279 of them minted from the keys of one JSON map column (tripl-10h4).

The predicate is :mod:`tripl.core.variable_retirement`, shared verbatim with the
owner-facing danger-zone endpoint. Only the queries differ — that module runs on
an ``AsyncSession`` and this one on the worker's sync ``Session`` — and that
split is the same one every other pair in this package lives with.

**This does not undo the run that just finished.** A variable minted by that run
had its token written into at least one event's field value by the same run — a
path enters ``all_paths`` only by appearing in a row, and that row's event
stores ``${col.path}`` — so the reference check keeps it. What the sweep removes
is the row whose token has since disappeared from every stored value, which is
exactly the fossil.

One case does mint and sweep in the same run, and it is the right answer rather
than an exception to apologise for: a path carried *only* by an ARCHIVED event.
A scan deliberately leaves an archived row's field values alone (tripl-rsei), so
the token is never written and nothing live refers to the variable.

Runs after the scan's ``session.commit()`` and before the search reindex, so the
reindex sees the retired set and the deletions cannot be rolled back by a later
failure in the same task.

**"Nothing refers to this" is judged against field values the run has just
rewritten, and the rewrite is where a variable's evidence is lost — not here.**
The run's catalog pass reads its window, re-plans every event's stored values
from what that window held, and ``_upsert_field_values`` overwrites any
non-authored value that differs; ``delete_variable_contexts_for_event_type``
then drops the field's contexts because the field was rewritten. A variable
whose token was in the old value and is not in the new one is left with no
stored token and no context — this predicate's fossil — the moment that
rewrite commits, whether or not a sweep follows. What the sweep adds is the
loss of the ROW: the next run that sees the token again mints a new id, runs
``derive_display_name`` afresh, and the catalog shows a retired/created pair
where nothing changed in the warehouse.

How wide that flicker is depends on what the variable was minted from, and
that is the split ``include_scalar_derived`` carries (tripl-bwo8):

- A SCALAR column's variable is one ``${token}`` per column, and it vanishes
  on the cardinality of the window: ``event_plan.plan_column_meta`` sets
  ``meta['is_low']`` from the window it was given (non-JSON branch only), and
  ``plan_events`` then writes a LITERAL where the template stood. A column that
  is high over the table can read low over one quiet hour, and then the whole
  column flips at once, on every event carrying it. Recycling that row is
  churn an operator will notice, so the scheduled caller still asks for a
  DECLARED ``scan_lookback_hours`` before it sweeps these — the operator has
  said which window represents the plan, and the flip is theirs to own.
- A JSON column's variables are its discovered paths, one per key, and the
  ``is_low`` arm cannot reach them: a JSON column has no template and no
  literal fallback. What a narrow window does to a JSON variable is drop a key
  that did not arrive this interval from the stored value rebuilt for that
  event (``build_json_value`` from the window's row). That is the "key that
  stopped arriving" the sweep exists for, seen over one hour instead of one
  table, and recycling a key nothing refers to is the point rather than a
  hazard. Measured 2026-09-03, 1929 of production's 1931 variables are
  JSON-derived (``windy-ios`` 1805/1807, ``android`` 77/77, ``web`` 47/47), so
  a gate on the whole call left the whole growth unswept for the sake of two
  rows.

``run_scan`` passes neither concern: an unset ``scan_lookback_hours`` leaves its
window ``None`` and it sees the whole table, so it sweeps everything on every
run. See ``collect_metrics`` for the scheduled caller's gate.

    task with no project-level lock (its advisory lock serialises the DISPATCH
