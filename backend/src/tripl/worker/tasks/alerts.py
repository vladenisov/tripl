    which is one thing however many messages carry it
    (website/docs/use/alerting.md). ``_build_template_context`` can only keep
    those apart if the caller says what the whole is — handed nothing, it
    summarises whatever it was asked to render.

    A Telegram resume renders the UNDELIVERED SUBSET, and that is exactly the
    caller that used to hand it nothing. The retried part of a 24-item digest
    therefore announced "9 alerts" over a window that opens hours after the one

    Nothing else keeps two workers off one delivery. The send tasks leave the
    row untouched from the load at the top until the message is already out —
    on the Slack/webhook paths the first write is ``payload_snapshot`` and the
    first commit is the ``status=sent`` one — so two tasks carrying the same id
    both read `pending` and both send. That is not hypothetical:
    ``requeue_stranded_alert_deliveries`` re-enqueues a row on age alone, and
    the worker runs prefork with no ``--concurrency`` flag (compose.yaml), so
    the backlog that makes a row look stranded is exactly the condition under
    which its first send is still running in another process.

    The paths that DO commit before ``status=sent`` commit no earlier than
    their own send call returning, and none of them closes this race: the
    ticket paths record the external issue id in a ``payload_snapshot`` commit
    of their own, which stops a sequential RE-RUN from filing a second ticket
    but not a concurrent worker holding the copy of the row it loaded before
    that commit landed, and Telegram commits once per accepted message
    (:func:`_record_delivered_items`).

    So the claim is a compare-and-set in its own committed transaction — the
    shape ``alert_flush`` claims a digest window with — and the commit is the
    point: an uncommitted claim is invisible to the other process, which is the
    whole failure mode. Callers run it BEFORE resolving the destination, so a
    duplicate dispatch costs one UPDATE instead of an AI round-trip, a set of
    sparkline queries and a second message.

    It is a LEASE, not a lock: a worker SIGKILLed between the claim and the
    terminal status write leaves ``claimed_at`` set with no transaction left to
    roll it back. The lease is deliberately ``STRANDED_DELIVERY_MINUTES``, the
    reaper's own horizon, so the first redispatch that arm makes is also the
    first claim that can win — a shorter lease would re-open the race this
    closes, a longer one would refuse the reaper's redispatch and burn a
    dispatch attempt on a no-op. The UPDATE also bumps ``updated_at`` through
    the column's ``onupdate``, which keeps the reaper's pending arm (which
    requires ``updated_at < cutoff``) off a row whose send is live.

    A row that is not `pending` cannot be claimed. `sent` is already handled by
    the early return in :func:`send_alert_delivery`; `failed` is not sendable
    until the reaper's failed arm or the Inbox Retry button flips it back, and
    both do that in a committed transaction of their own.

    destination selects — so a row exists at all only because the toggle was on

    minting and sending, and that interval is not the millisecond it sounds
    like: a ``.delay()`` lost to a broker restart, the stranded-delivery
    reaper's fifteen-minute redispatch, and the Inbox Retry button each hand an
    OLD row to a send task, and the toggle can have moved since. So the check

    Called where the send tasks call it — at the top, before the render — this

    delivery naming the cause, instead of an alert that simply never arrived.
    Nothing resurrects that row behind the operator's back either: the reaper's
    failed arm excludes disabled destinations by design, and a hand-pressed
    Retry meets this same guard while the toggle is still off.

    The **Test** button is deliberately NOT subject to this. It is a separate

    entire batch of other members rendered and committed. That is the window an

    keeps the value it was loaded with rather than raising, because the only
