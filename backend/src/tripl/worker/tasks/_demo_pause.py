"""Is a demo PAUSED? — the single definition, shared by every worker path.

A demo whose last explicit activity is older than :data:`DEMO_IDLE_PAUSE_MINUTES`
is paused: it stops consuming worker time until someone opens it again
(``project_service.get_project`` touches ``Project.demo_last_accessed_at``, which
resumes it on the next beat tick).

Why the rule lives in a module of its own
-----------------------------------------
Both ``worker.tasks.demo_runtime.advance_demos`` (which appends the demo's hourly
buckets) and ``worker.tasks.metrics.schedule.check_metrics_due`` (which dispatches
its scheduled collection) have to answer this question, and they MUST answer it
identically — see below. Importing the predicate straight from ``demo_runtime``
would be acyclic today, but it would drag ``tripl.cache``, ``tripl.realtime``, the
anomaly detector and three demo builders into the dispatcher's import graph for
one four-line rule. This subsystem already parks its shared rules in leaf modules
for exactly that reason: ``core.collection_progress`` and ``core.bucketing`` each
open by naming the several callers that must agree on them.

Why the two callers must not each roll their own idleness test (tripl-0zpq.72)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tick is what keeps the newest ``EventMetric`` bucket moving. While it is
paused that bucket freezes, so ``collection_progress_to`` — the resume point the
collector derives its window start from — freezes with it, and the next scheduled
collection's window stretches back to cover the whole gap instead of the usual two
buckets. Against the synthetic demo warehouse that is actively destructive: the
adapter only materialises its newest ``SYNTHETIC_ONGOING_HOURS`` at full volume
and emits a handful of sampled rows per hour before that, while the collector
deletes each chunk window before rewriting it. A window reaching behind the
ongoing hours therefore replaces hours of real history with near-zero counts, over
and over, for as long as the demo stays paused. Two thresholds that drift apart
re-open precisely that window.
