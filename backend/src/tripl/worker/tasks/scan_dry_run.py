"""Celery task for the scan dry run: "what would this scan create?".

Split out of ``worker.tasks.scan`` (tripl-28g7) purely for size — that module
crossed the repo's 800-line guideline and the dry-run half is self-contained
behind one entry point, ``build_dry_run_payload``.

Two things did NOT move and must not:

* The Celery task name is still ``tripl.worker.tasks.scan.dry_run_scan_config_async``.
  It is what the broker routes on, so renaming it would strand every in-flight
  job queued by a running deployment. The name is a wire identifier, not a
  filename.
* ``_get_sync_session`` and ``_build_adapter`` stay imported at MODULE level
  here, because that is the namespace ``dry_run_scan_config_async.run`` closes
  over and the tests patch through ``run.__globals__``. Moving either behind a
  function-local import would silently stop the patch taking effect and point
  the test suite at a real database.
