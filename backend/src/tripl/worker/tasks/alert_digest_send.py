"""One outbound message per destination, for a scheduled digest (tripl-o0u7).

``flush_due_alert_digests`` mints one ``AlertDelivery`` per (rule, scan config)
— that is what keeps per-rule templates, the Inbox, delivery history, Retry and
``_stamp_rule_state`` working exactly as they do on the immediate path. But
dispatching them one by one means a destination with N rules gets N separate
messages at 09:00, which is the burst the digest exists to remove.

So the combining happens at the TRANSPORT layer and nowhere else: every
delivery is still prepared individually, through the same guards and the same
renderer ``send_alert_delivery`` uses, and only the outbound call is shared.
Nothing about the row model, the templates or the schema changes.

**Only Slack and email combine.** Each of them is exactly one outbound call per
delivery today, so bundling is a straight concatenation with no new failure
mode. Deliberately excluded:

* **Telegram** — it already splits ONE delivery across several messages against
  a 4096-character ceiling and carries a per-delivery resume set plus a
  MarkdownV2→plain fallback. Bundling would make one rule's bad template
  silently downgrade every other rule in the digest, and a partially-accepted
  group has no per-rule resume story. It keeps today's path.
* **Jira / Linear** — one ticket per delivery is the documented contract, the
  create is not idempotent, and its dedup guard is a per-delivery external id.
* **Webhook** — the body is a documented singular-``rule`` consumer contract.
* **demo_sink** — local, non-sendable; there is no call to share.

Anything not combined is simply dispatched the way it always was, so this task
is never the only path to a channel.
