"""Which buckets a scan config's collection actually covered.

Lifted out of ``tasks.py`` when a second caller appeared: the catalog-metric
detection pass resolves coverage PER METRIC, from the scan config whose grid the
metric's values were collected on — which is not necessarily the config the
running scan belongs to (see
``detect._recalculate_project_metric_anomalies``).

Pure leaf (models + the timestamp helper) so both the orchestrator and the
detector import it without a cycle.

Bucket convention
-----------------
**Every bucket this module returns is TZ-AWARE UTC**, and so is every bound it
compares one against. That is the same convention
``worker.analyzers.metric_composition.normalize_series`` already imposes where
two independently sourced series meet (tripl-ju0d), and the one
``core.bucketing`` states for the whole pipeline: a naive datetime IS UTC, it
just has not said so.

It has to be stated, because this set is built from halves that disagree by
nature:

* the job-window half parses ``result_summary`` through ``_parse_task_datetime``
  and is aware UTC no matter what;
* the presence half is a raw ``event_metrics.bucket`` read, which yields AWARE
  values on PostgreSQL (``timestamptz``) and NAIVE ones on SQLite;
* the caller's ``current_window``/``history_from`` are whatever the orchestrator
  minted, which the same split reaches through ``max(EventMetric.bucket)``.

Scope of the defect this convention closes, stated exactly: the set was only ever
mixed on SQLITE. On PostgreSQL every half was already aware — ``timestamptz``
columns, ``_parse_task_datetime``, and an orchestrator window minted from an
aware clock — and Python compares and hashes aware datetimes BY INSTANT, so even
a set holding two different offsets keys alike. Production was NOT under-reporting
coverage. On SQLite the series buckets the detector loads come back naive too, so
only the stored-bucket half of the union could ever match them.

The warning that survives is about the consumer and applies to any producer on
any backend: ``anomaly_detector.expand_series`` does a plain
``bucket not in covered`` membership test, and ``datetime(t)`` and
``datetime(t, tzinfo=UTC)`` are neither equal nor equal-hashing. A producer that
skips the boundary silently contributes dead entries — nothing raises, coverage
under-reports, and an uncovered bucket is EXCLUDED from the series rather than
zero-filled, so genuinely-zero buckets vanish from every baseline with no error
anywhere.

**A new producer conforms by calling ``to_utc`` at the point its value ENTERS
this module** — never at the membership test, which is a set lookup and cannot
convert. The matching obligation on the consumer side lives in
``detect._load_scope_points`` / ``_load_metric_value_points`` /
``_load_breakdown_scope_points``, which stamp the series buckets the same way.

    """Buckets a successful collection actually covered, on the interval grid.

    A collection gap (an interval that a failed/never-run job left uncollected)
    is otherwise zero-filled by the detector and masquerades as a 'drop'
    anomaly. We union the ``[time_from, time_to)`` windows of every COMPLETED
    scan job (recorded in ``result_summary``) with the window this run just
    wrote, and hand the enumerated set to ``detect_anomalies`` as
    ``covered_buckets`` so a MISSING bucket is only zero-filled when it fell
    inside real coverage; missing-and-uncovered buckets are excluded instead of
    read as zeros.

    Every bucket that already carries stored data is unioned in as well: data
    only exists because a collection produced it, so a present observation is by
    definition covered. This keeps the baseline intact even for buckets whose
    originating job window is no longer recorded, and never marks a genuine gap
    (which has no row) as covered.

    ``history_from`` bounds the whole computation to the oldest bucket the
    caller's detector pass can consult, and is REQUIRED: both reads are over a
    config's entire lifetime otherwise (an hourly config a year old carries
    ~8,800 completed jobs, and the ``event_metrics`` DISTINCT is one row per
    event per bucket on top of that), while ``expand_series`` starts at the
    oldest point the pass loaded and never tests a bucket below its own
    ``history_from``. The bound must stay TIME-based: a recent-N row limit would
    leave every older bucket uncovered, and an uncovered bucket is EXCLUDED from
    the series rather than zero-filled, so genuinely-zero buckets would silently
    drop out of every baseline.

    ``current_window`` is the window the caller's run just wrote, unioned in
    because a bucket the scan observed as zero has no stored row and no
    completed job summary yet. It is absent when the caller is asking about a
    FOREIGN config, which this run wrote nothing for; ``presence_before`` then
    supplies the upper bound for the stored-bucket read.

    Every returned bucket is tz-aware UTC regardless of what the caller passed in
    or what the database column yielded — see the module docstring for why that
    is a contract and not an implementation detail.
