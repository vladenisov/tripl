    A failure here costs this run its contract check and nothing more. That is a
    deliberate swallow, and it is the narrowest one that fixes what it has to:
    contract evaluation is ONE part of a catalog sync, this function is called
    once per event-type group inside ``catalog_sync``'s loop, and neither it nor
    the loop caught anything — so a single expectation the warehouse would not
    accept ended the whole collection, the config stayed due, and it failed again
    on every retry with ``"Scan failed due to an internal error."`` The
    expectations are replayed from contracts a user declared long ago and a
    column can change type or a pattern can stop compiling under them, so a
    permanently-wedged config was reachable without anyone touching the config.

    An ``except Exception`` is the thing to distrust in a change like this, so it
    carries all three of the guarantees that make it legible rather than
    convenient:

    * curated errors are re-raised. ``ScanError`` / ``NameFormatError`` /
      ``WarehouseCapabilityError`` carry an author-written sentence naming the
      setting to change, and ``user_facing_error`` surfaces it verbatim. Those
      the operator can act on; hiding one behind a counter would trade a
      diagnosable failure for an undiagnosable success.
    * the traceback is logged (``logger.exception``, not a message), because the
      class of thing being swallowed includes genuine adapter bugs and the log is
      then the only record of one.
    * the failure is COUNTED and reaches the job summary as
      ``contract_checks_failed`` (see ``CatalogSyncResult`` and the summary in
      ``tasks``). A swallow that reports nothing is the anti-pattern; this one
      reports every time it fires.

    ``contract_checks_failed`` counts only that whole-check failure. A single
    expectation the adapter declined while the rest ran is not an exception and
    never reaches the ``except``; it is read back from the adapter and reported
    separately as ``contract_expectations_skipped`` (see ``FieldContractOutcome``).

    The ``try`` wraps the warehouse call ONLY. A failure writing the drift rows
    belongs to the session, and the task's rollback has to see it: swallowing
    that would report violations the database does not hold.

    What a failed check leaves behind is what a passing one would have: nothing
    on this path ever resolves a drift row — ``_upsert_schema_drifts`` only
    inserts and refreshes — so an open contract drift stays open either way. That
    is the right reading: "we could not check" must not become "it is clean now".
