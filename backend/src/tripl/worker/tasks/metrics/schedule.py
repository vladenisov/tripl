# How rarely a DEMO project's scheduled collection may run (tripl-jfm3.73).
#
# A demo pays 67-141 s per collection against an in-memory dataset, and every
# demo on a deployment paid it every hour. Almost all of that is per-scope
# MSTL(24,168) — 21 volume scopes plus 81-131 breakdown scopes at ~1.2 s each —
# and none of the existing fast paths apply, because demo volumes sit far above
# ``min_expected_count`` and every demo series is unique so the decomposition
# cache added for tripl-jfm3.1 has nothing to reuse.
#
# The demo does NOT go dark between runs: ``advance_demos`` already appends
# hourly buckets and re-runs the real detector for volume anomalies every hour,
# so the series and the headline signals stay live. What this cooldown defers is
# the part only the scheduled collection produces — breakdown anomalies and
# distribution drift — from 24x a day to 4x, which for a demo is invisible.
#
# Deliberately NOT implemented by lengthening ``ScanConfig.interval``: that is
# the BUCKET size, and the demo's whole seasonality story (periods 24 and 168 in
# hourly buckets, 23 days of history) is built on it being 1h.

# warehouse query, and the junk rows pushed real scan history out of the API's
# 200-row window.
