"""Celery task that collects per-bucket values for catalog MetricDefinitions.

Mirrors ``collect_metrics`` (event metrics) but writes Float values into
``metric_values`` / ``metric_value_breakdowns`` for one ``MetricDefinition`` per
run. Three kinds are supported:

* ``fact`` -- an aggregation over a column of a separately-defined ``FactTable``,
  via ``adapter.get_time_bucketed_aggregate`` (+ optional per-dimension
  breakdowns via ``get_time_bucketed_aggregate_breakdown``). ``single`` collects
  one operand series; ``ratio`` divides a numerator series by a denominator
  series (each operand a — possibly different — FactTable). The base query, time
  column and data source are taken from the referenced FactTable; a named row
  filter is resolved to its stored SQL fragment at collection time.
* ``sql`` -- a user-authored per-bucket SELECT, executed via
  ``adapter.get_preview_rows`` after a defensive ``validate_select_sql`` that
  binds the value/time column names.
* ``event_composition`` -- derived from already-collected ``event_metrics`` on
  the source scan grid: ``single`` count, ``ratio`` A/B, or
  ``per_distinct_user`` (numerator / per-bucket distinct-user count, the latter
  being a fresh warehouse ``count_distinct`` series).

Idempotency: every kind WINDOW-DELETEs the affected ``(definition[, config])``
rows before UPSERTing, so a re-run overwrites a window instead of duplicating
it. ``fact`` / ``sql`` write ``scan_config_id = NULL`` rows;
``event_composition`` writes rows keyed by the source ``scan_config_id`` grid.

NOTE on divide-by-zero: ``metric_values.value`` is NOT NULL (see the M2 model /
migration), so a ``ratio`` / ``per_distinct_user`` bucket whose denominator is
zero -- which the pure evaluator maps to ``None`` -- is NOT written. The
window-delete-then-insert pass means any previously stored value for that bucket
is cleared, so the bucket reads back as "no value" (absent) rather than a
misleading ``0``.

Tests monkey-patch ``_get_sync_session``, ``_build_adapter`` and
``_resolve_value_window`` as globals of THIS module.

    """Why this metric can never produce a value, or ``None`` if it can.

    An ``event_composition`` metric reads an already-collected series through
    ``_read_event_metric_series``, which returns ``{}`` for TWO different
    situations that the collector then treated identically:

    * the operand is configured and simply has no rows yet — legitimately zero,
      and it must stay silent;
    * the metric has no operand AT ALL, both the event ref and the event-type
      ref being NULL — structurally unable to produce anything, ever.

    Reporting the second as ``{"values": 0, "grids": 0}`` is what made tripl-jtnv
    invisible for as long as it was: a SUCCESS with zero rows leaves
    ``last_collection_status`` green, and ``_event_composition_due`` then reads
    the same empty series and returns ``False`` forever, so the scheduler stops
    asking. The metric flatlines and nothing anywhere says why.

    A user cannot reach this state by hand — the schemas require a numerator on
    create and on update, and a denominator for ``ratio`` — so a NULL operand is
    ALWAYS the footprint of an ``ondelete="SET NULL"``: a deleted event
    (tripl-jtnv, now also carried by the group merge) or a deleted event type
    (tripl-nmn3). Checking the binding rather than the deleting door is the
    point: one kind-level guard covers every present and future door.

    and because ``_clear_collected_metric_data`` wipes every stored value on any
    material definition edit, editing such a metric would DESTROY the part of its
    chart the next run could not re-derive.

    So each run also walks the frontier backwards by one bounded step: at most
    ``EVENT_COMPOSITION_BACKFILL_BUCKETS`` intervals below the metric's own oldest
    stored bucket, and never below the oldest bucket the source series actually
    has. A long history is filled in over successive dispatches instead of being
    unreachable, while the work per run stays bounded by the same constant that
    bounds the first run — two bounded regions, never an unbounded re-query.

    The ceiling is clamped to ``resume_floor`` so the chunk cannot overlap the
    resume region and compose the same buckets twice in one run. Buckets BETWEEN
    the frontier and the resume floor are already composed and are still not
    revisited: this fills gaps, it does not repair a stored value whose source
    changed underneath it.

    One honest limit: the frontier is the stored MIN, and a bucket whose composed
    value is ``None`` (divide-by-zero) stores no row. A chunk in which every
    bucket divides by zero therefore leaves the frontier where it was and is
    retried on the next dispatch. That costs one bounded pass per run and cannot
    error; it is not a permanent failure.

# per-aggregate conditional so metrics with different filters still share one
# scan. The per-bucket VALUES are identical to the per-metric path: an unfiltered
# aggregate over the fact SQL equals the single-aggregate path, and a conditional
# aggregate equals the same aggregate over the row-filtered subquery.


# A spec's dedup identity: same aggregation, same measure/distinct column and
# the same combined filter expression aggregate to the SAME warehouse column, so
# two metrics needing the same aggregate share one column in the scan. The
# combined filter string (built deterministically by ``_resolve_combined_filter``)
# is the true identity, so equal effective filters — whatever named/free-text mix
# produced them — dedup to one column.

    The save doors (``load_project_data_source`` for a ``sql`` metric,

    and rows written before them walked in while they were open: this collector
    resolves the credential by primary key alone and the beat dispatches every
    active metric with no scoping join, so such a row kept running its project's
    free-text SELECT under a foreign warehouse credential, unattended, forever
    (tripl-0zpq.347).

    Called on EVERY credential this module opens, not just the ``sql`` one: the
    fact half reaches its warehouse through ``fact_tables.data_source_id``, and
    ``_load_fact_table`` scopes the fact TABLE to the metric's project while
    nothing scoped the source behind it. That half needs the guard MORE, because
    tripl-0zpq.177 tightened its save door from "a ScanConfig binds this source
    to this project" to ownership — so a stored binding the save door would now
    refuse (a workspace-global source this project has since stopped scanning,
    or one owned by another project) survives untouched in ``fact_tables`` and
    is honoured on every tick.

    The verdict is the SAME predicate the save doors apply
    (:func:`data_source_out_of_project_scope`) — one rule, every caller — so a
    legacy row now fails loudly, with a red metric and a message an owner can
    act on, instead of quietly succeeding.

    Takes ``project_id`` rather than the metric definition because the batched

    additionally fetches a warehouse distinct-user denominator per grid.

    Each grid is composed in at most TWO bounded regions per run, never over its
    full retained history:

    * the RESUME region (``_composition_series_floor``) — two buckets before the
      metric's own last stored bucket on that grid plus everything newer, or at

    That bound is why: the previous full-history re-derivation meant a
    ``per_distinct_user`` metric re-queried the warehouse over its entire retained
    history on EVERY dispatch, and died permanently once that history exceeded
    ``METRIC_QUERY_ROW_LIMIT`` buckets. Two bounded regions keep that fixed while

    What is still given up: buckets the metric has ALREADY composed, between its
    oldest stored bucket and the resume floor, are not revisited. A historical
    event-metric bucket that changes after its composed value has scrolled out of
    the resume region is therefore not recomputed — the backfill fills gaps, it
    does not repair a stored value whose source changed underneath it.

    ``window`` and ``manual_backfill`` are accepted for a uniform collector
    signature but ignored: an event_composition metric has no interval of its

    """Collect a batch of fact metrics, sharing one warehouse scan per fact table.

    Loads the requested metrics, keeps only the active ``fact`` ones, and runs the
    batched collector. Per-metric ``last_collected_at`` / ``last_collection_status``
    stamping and error capture happen inside the collector, so one metric failing
    never aborts the others; this wrapper only owns the session lifecycle. An
    optional ``window_from`` / ``window_to`` pair (ISO strings) backfills an
    explicit common window for legacy callers. ``manual_backfill_all`` is used
    when collect-now expands to all fact-table dependants: every compatible
    interval group computes its own bounded manual window, while all metrics on
    the same fact table and interval still share one multi-aggregate query.

    ``force`` is set only by the manual "collect now" trigger: it keeps non-active
    (draft/archived) fact metrics in the batch so a freshly-created metric still
    produces data. The scheduler always dispatches with ``force=False``, so
    scheduled collection stays active-only.
