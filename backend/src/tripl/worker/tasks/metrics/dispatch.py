    silenced exactly the bucket already delivered, and an hour later an unseen
    group alerted again (tripl-jfm3.91). Leaving it out makes the group live as
    long as the incident does, and it must stay out.

    The SCOPE is present because ``_SUPPRESSING_INBOX_STATUSES`` gates the whole
    group. Keyed on scan_config:rule:direction alone, one inbox action silenced
    every other scope the rule watched, and the sole release path

    Without this, suppression would be permanent: acknowledging a drop would
    silence that scope's drops forever. Called for the scopes whose alert state
    is closed, so their next firing is a new incident and alerts normally.

    Per SCOPE, matching ``_correlation_group_id``. The old rule-wide reset needed
    every scope of the rule to be quiet at once, which a suppressed scope could
    never be — it kept firing, unseen, holding its own release hostage.

    ONE PARTITION PER CALL. ``scan_config_id`` is the partition the ids being
    released were minted under — ``None`` for the project-global ``metric``
    scopes, the firing config for every other scope — so a caller whose closed
    keys span both makes two calls (``_prepare_alert_deliveries`` does). Ids
    rebuilt under the wrong partition match no stored row, and a release that
    matches nothing is a suppression that never ends: the incident stays
    acknowledged forever and its scope can never alert again.

    A mute is deliberately excluded, timed or indefinite. "Acknowledged" means
    "I am on this incident" and dies with it; "muted until T" means "do not tell
    me before T" regardless of what the signal does in between. Resetting it here
    killed a seven-day mute on the first quiet collection and paged the user
    again hours later (tripl-jfm3.98).

    An INDEFINITE mute (``muted_until`` NULL — "muted until I unmute") is the
    same promise with no T at all, and is the one a fall-through hurts most: its
    release is a deliberate human act, so nothing downstream would ever restore
    the row. The check below is therefore ``muted_until is None or muted_until >
    now`` and NOT ``is not None and > now``, which read a NULL as an expiry
    infinitely far in the past and silently released the strongest mute in the
    product on the first quiet scan (tripl-a50u). Unreachable until the inbox
    validator started accepting a mute with no expiry, which is precisely why it
    had to be fixed in the same change.

    Note the OPPOSITE shape at the rule-mute check in
    ``_prepare_alert_deliveries``: on an ``AlertRule`` a NULL ``muted_until``
    means NOT MUTED, because a rule carries no status column to tell "never
    muted" from "muted forever" and NULL is the default on every rule ever
    created. The two lines look alike and must not be made to agree — see
    ``AlertInboxActionRequest.validate_action``.

    A LAPSED mute is still reopened, by ``_suppressed_correlation_group_ids``, so
    mutes have their own lifecycle and this function does not run it.

#
# Sized off the 29 Telegram deliveries windy-ios has ever sent ("TG dev",
# default templates, AI note attached): least squares over their
# (matched_count, rendered chars) gave 400 chars per item on a 516-char base,
# which crosses 4096 just under 9 items — and on the widest base observed (682,
# the AI note varies) exactly at 8.
#
# Those renders PREDATE aafa632, which collapsed the duplicate
# details/monitoring line when both resolve to the same page — worth about 90
# characters per item on an event scope, so the honest present-day crossover is
# nearer 13 than 9. Keeping 8 anyway: the per-item cost varies fourfold with
# which optional lines an item carries (97-389 chars across those same
# deliveries), the item template is user-editable, and being early with a second
# message costs nothing while being late costs the whole delivery.
#
# No delivery that large exists yet: the biggest real one is 5 items / 2420
# chars, because volume scopes could not alert at all (see
# ``signals._emission_lag``). The replay that unblocks them rendered 14 items /
# 4154 chars, which is when this ceiling starts to matter.
#
# This bounds the ITEM COUNT, not characters: the item template is user-editable
# and the AI explanation is generated after dispatch, so a chunk this size can
# still overshoot. The hard 4096 ceiling is enforced where the finished message
# exists — ``alerts_messages.split_telegram_messages`` measures each one
# assembled, in Telegram's UTF-16 units, and sends a chunk as several messages
# when it has to. This estimate stays anyway: it costs nothing and keeps the

    """Hold matched signals for this destination's next digest window.

    Upsert, not insert: a scope that keeps firing is re-offered on every
    collection, and each one overwrites its buffered row with the newest
    numbers, so a scope firing all day occupies exactly one line — ONE PER
    DIRECTION. The key is ``_correlation_group_id``'s five components plus the
    destination, ``direction`` among them, so one buffered row stands for
    exactly one incident and one Inbox card.

    A scope that DROPPED at 03:00 and SPIKED at 11:00 therefore buffers two
    rows and ships two lines, one in each of the digest's two groups. That is
    the intended reading — two real movements, two incidents, two things an
    operator can acknowledge separately — and it is the common case rather than
    a corner: 106 of 223 live scopes fired in BOTH directions inside one day
    (``models/alert_rule``).

    Collapsing the pair was proposed both ways and neither is available
    (tripl-0zpq.108):

    * DROP ``direction`` from the key and one row stands for two incidents
      while ``correlation_group_id`` is a single column that can name only one.
      ``alert_flush._build_digest`` filters on exactly that value, so whichever
      handle survived, an acknowledgement of the drop would either be ignored
      or silently swallow the spike nobody acknowledged.
    * DELETE the sibling on a flip and an incident that was already buffered is
      destroyed before it is ever delivered, which nothing re-offers:
      ``AlertRuleState`` carries no direction, so the flipped scope is already
      reusing that one state row, and ``last_notified_at`` is stamped only on a
      SENT delivery.

    So the digest is every incident that fired inside the window, each with its
    OWN latest numbers — not a snapshot of what is broken at the fire instant.
    Nothing prunes a buffered row when its scope falls quiet either (the only
    deletes are this flush's own claim, the 14-day sweep, the service discarding
    the whole buffer when the destination is disabled, and — when its cadence is
    cleared — the service discarding only the PART of the buffer whose scopes
    the immediate path provably re-delivers, which is that same trap avoided on
    the other side of the handoff), so a scope that fired once at 03:00 and
    stopped still ships that 03:00 line. The flipped drop is no staler than that one: it is its
    incident's last true reading.

    Values are snapshotted rather than referenced. ``_recalculate_*`` deletes
    and rewrites the anomaly rows on every collection, so by flush time the row
    this was built from is gone; ``AlertDeliveryItem.window_from`` carries the
    same warning for the same reason.
