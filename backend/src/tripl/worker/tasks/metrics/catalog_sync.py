"""Phase 1 of metrics collection: catalog sync via the scan pipeline.

Extracted verbatim from ``collect_metrics`` in ``tasks.py``.  The cardinality
analyzers and ``generate_events`` are passed in as callables so that tests
monkey-patching them on the ``tasks`` module keep taking effect (``tasks``
forwards its module globals at call time).

Phase 1 also samples the observed values of JSON-path variables, which is not
the scan pipeline's own work but has to happen here: it is the one point in a
collection job that runs ONCE, before the per-chunk metric loop, so a replay's
hundreds of chunks cannot multiply it. See ``_collect_json_path_samples``.

    A variable is a candidate when one of its warehouse identities splits as
    ``<column>.<path>`` over a JSON column of this query — ``source_tokens_of``,
    so ``source_name`` and the user-editable bindings lead and the shortened
    display name (``property.Aalter`` -> ``aalter``) cannot be mistaken for a
    path — and at least one context row for it still holds no observation.

    The unit is the CONTEXT, not the variable, because the context is what the
    fill writes: ``variable_values`` is keyed on (variable, event, field), while
    ONE variable covers every event that references the path — across scan
    configs too, since a Variable is unique on (project, branch, source_name)
    and this query is project/branch-scoped with no config in it. Retiring a
    variable on its first observation anywhere therefore stranded every context
    minted after it: a new event on the path, an existing event that later gained
    the field or the token, a context ``delete_variable_contexts_for_event_type``
    dropped and a later run re-created, and a sibling config's events whenever
    another config sampled the shared path first. Each was written with
    ``observed_count=0`` and could never be asked about again — the production
    symptom this sampler exists to fix, back for everything but the first event.

    "Holds no observation" is tested on ``observed_count``, an Integer column, and
    deliberately NOT on ``values``: that column is ``sa.JSON`` and not JSONB, so
    on PostgreSQL ``json = json`` has no operator and a ``!= '[]'`` comparison
    fails outright — the trap ``services._alerting_scope_readiness`` documents at
    length. The two questions have the same answer anyway, because every writer
    of a context sets the count to at least ``len(values)``.

    The sampling stays self-extinguishing, one context later than it used to be:
    a variable leaves the candidate set once every context it has is observed, so
    a project that has converged pays the two indexed queries below and issues no
    warehouse call at all.
