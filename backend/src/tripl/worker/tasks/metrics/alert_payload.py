    ``delivery_id`` is threaded in because release-regression items link back
    to this delivery's own audit row — the only surface that can show their
    numbers for one scope. Callers flush the delivery first so the id exists;
    ``None`` degrades to a link-less item rather than a wrong one.

    ``app_base_url`` arrives the same way, and is required rather than
    defaulted so that this snapshot and the typed ``AlertDeliveryItem`` rows
    minted beside it come from ONE read of the setting rather than two.
    ``app_settings_service.get_runtime_config_sync`` has no cache and swallows
    a failed read, falling back to the env config whose ``app_base_url`` is
    ``""`` — and every builder in ``urls.py`` returns ``None`` on an empty
    base. Two independent reads could therefore hand this frozen blob a
    different base from the rows it is frozen beside, or no links at all beside
    rows that have them, with nothing but a ``logger.warning`` to say why.
    ``dispatch._create_deliveries`` resolves the value once, before the chunk
    loop, and hands that one string here and to the per-item
    ``_build_item_paths`` call that mints the rows.

    That buys agreement about the BASE, and deliberately nothing more. This is
    the FIRST of the two ``_build_item_paths`` calls per item — the snapshot is
    frozen right after the delivery flushes, before the loop that mints the
    rows — and it passes no ``correlation_group_id``, which the row call does
    pass (both mint paths fill that map for every anomaly). So for an ordinary
    scope the two encodings carry different link SHAPES on purpose: the row
    gets the incident-anchored audit URL and a ``None`` monitoring path, while
    the frozen item keeps the pre-incident pair — event details plus a
    monitoring page. Nothing renders a link out of this blob; the message, the
    webhook body and the Inbox all read the typed rows (``alerts_messages``,
    ``AlertDeliveryRow.tsx``), so re-shaping it would rewrite audit history for
    no reader.
