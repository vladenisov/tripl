# We keep a tiny POSITIVE floor rather than a blanket 0 so a genuinely
# empty/flatlined-at-zero fractional series can't manufacture multi-sigma
# anomalies from pure noise — the detector lane widens the stddev floor, this
# preserves the volume guard (tripl-dmch.17).
#
# On a series that actually carries negative values the detector reads this as a
# floor on |expected| (``anomaly_detector._clears_volume_gate``): a ratio
# flatlined at 0 is still gated, while a level sitting at -100 is scored exactly
# like one at +100 instead of being rejected for its sign (tripl-0zpq.102).

# (tripl-dmch.14). Replays over a wider explicit window keep that wider window.
#
# The count is in buckets OF THE SERIES BEING SCORED, which is why it lives here
# rather than in the scan orchestrator: catalog metrics carry their own grid.
# Multiplying it by the scan config's 1h delta gave a 1d metric a 30-HOUR
# window — one candidate bucket, which the settling allowance then withheld, so

# used as a ``created_at`` floor without dropping a job whose window reaches back
# past it. BOTH callers of ``covered_buckets_from_scan_jobs`` apply it — the
# running scan's horizon in ``coverage_history_start`` and the per-metric horizon
# in ``_metric_covered_buckets`` — because a job dropped from either read costs
# the same thing: every genuinely-zero bucket it covered is EXCLUDED from the

# ── the subsystem's ONE bucket convention ────────────────────────────────────
# Every bucket compared, hashed or set-tested inside detection is TZ-AWARE UTC.
# It is a real decision, not an accident of the first value that arrived:
#
#  * ``core.bucketing`` already declares it for the whole pipeline ("a naive
#    datetime is ASSUMED to be UTC"), and ``metric_composition.normalize_series``
#    already enforces it at the other junction where two series meet (tripl-ju0d);
#  * PostgreSQL — what production runs on — hands back aware values from every
#    ``timestamptz`` bucket column, so aware is the majority convention already;
#  * the alternative (strip to naive) would have to UNDO a correct annotation on
#    the production backend and would still leave ``datetime.now(UTC)`` and every
#    parsed ``result_summary`` bound to convert at each use.
#
# Naive values still ENTER, from two places and two only: a bucket column read on
# a backend without timezone support (SQLite, in tests), and a window handed in by
# a caller. Both are stamped at the boundary — the loaders below, the entrypoints
# below that, and ``coverage.covered_buckets_from_scan_jobs`` — so nothing
# downstream converts. In particular ``anomaly_detector.expand_series`` tests
# ``bucket not in covered_buckets``: a set lookup CANNOT normalize, a mismatch
# there raises nothing, and the silent result is that coverage under-reports and
# genuinely-zero buckets are dropped from the baseline instead of zero-filled.
#
# A new producer conforms by calling ``to_utc`` where its value enters, never at
# the comparison.

    Every source config collecting the metric ON THE RESOLVED GRID'S INTERVAL,

    :func:`_load_metric_value_points` sums, what
    :func:`_metric_source_config_ids` reads coverage back for, and — because a
    ``metric``-scope ``MetricAnomaly`` carries a NULL ``scan_config_id`` and so

    mirror is ``metric_series_service._grid_population_filter``; the two must
    stay in step and belong together in :mod:`tripl.metric_grid`, next to the
    grid rule they extend.

    Interval, not config id, because an ``event_composition`` metric legitimately
    has more than one LIVE source: ``EventMetric`` is keyed on (scan_config_id,
    event_id, bucket) and ``_collect_event_composition`` writes one
    ``MetricValue`` row set per source grid, so one event type collected by two
    scans contributes two addends of one total. Narrowing to the grid's own
    config would score one addend, chosen by ``metric_grid_stmt``'s
    ``ORDER BY bucket DESC`` tie-break, which is undefined between two
    equally-current configs and so could flap between runs.

    But NOT every config regardless of interval, which is what this used to do:
    a retired 1h grid and a live 1d grid are different units, and summing them
    per bucket added an hour's count to a day's at every shared midnight while
    the series was scored on the 1d delta. The interval is the line between
    "another source of this series" and "a retired grid".

    ``scan_config_id is None`` on the grid means ``sql``/``fact``: those rows are
    written with a NULL ``scan_config_id`` exclusively, so the IS NULL branch is
    exact rather than merely narrower and the interval never enters. A ``None``
    grid (the metric row vanished mid-run) takes the same branch and matches
    nothing, which is the safe answer.

    Only a count-shaped series ever consults it (``expand_series`` runs behind
    ``fill_gaps``), and the right answer depends on where the values came from:

    * ``fact`` / ``sql`` metrics collect on their own ``interval``, on their own
      schedule, and store ``scan_config_id = NULL``. No scan job ever recorded a
      window for them, so no scan's coverage describes them at all; ``None``
      keeps the documented unconditional zero-fill.
    * an ``event_composition`` metric gets the UNION of ITS GRID POPULATION's
      configs' coverage, each re-enumerated on the metric's own delta. The source
      reading THIS scan on THIS scan's grid contributes the running scan's set
      verbatim: it is already on the right delta, and it uniquely carries the
      window this run just wrote. Every other source is read from its own
      completed jobs and stored buckets.

    The union — rather than the newest value's single ``scan_config_id`` — is
    what keeps coverage describing the SAME population the series is summed
    from. ``_load_metric_value_points`` sums across every config on the metric's
    grid interval (:func:`_metric_grid_population`), because one event type can
    legitimately be collected by two live scans (``EventMetric`` is keyed on
    (scan_config_id, event_id, bucket) and ``_collect_event_composition`` writes
    one ``MetricValue`` row per source grid). Masking that summed series with ONE
    source's coverage drops every bucket only the other source contributed —
    ``expand_series`` EXCLUDES an uncovered bucket rather than zero-filling it,
    even when a real value is sitting there — and which source that was is an
    arbitrary ``ORDER BY bucket DESC`` tie-break between two equally-current
    configs (:func:`tripl.metric_grid.metric_grid_stmt`), so the truncation could
    also flap between runs. A union has no tie to break.

    ``grid`` bounds the union to the same configs the values came from, so a
    RETIRED grid on another interval — whose rows are no longer part of the
    series — cannot vouch for buckets of it either.

    ``None`` still means "no coverage gating, zero-fill unconditionally", and a
    source whose set is unknown forces it: the running scan contributing a
    ``None`` set would otherwise let the other sources' coverage silently
    exclude buckets nobody vouched against.

    ``memo`` keys on (source config, delta), which is enough: ``history_from``
    is a pure function of the delta and the run's evaluation window, so two
    metrics sharing both share a set.
