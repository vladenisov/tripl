# Capped because that message is an outbound payload on a timer: beat's

# Slack and email destination, and the list only grows — nothing takes an event
# off it but retiring the event or clearing its sunset_at, since last_seen_at is
# monotonic (metrics.collect._bump_event_last_seen only ever moves it forward).

# message exists beside the count. 50 and not more, because ``events.name`` is

# characters and stay inside the 40,000 Slack accepts in a "text" field. Past

    Returns (text, the items that text carries) in send order, so the caller
    knows exactly what has gone out if a later message fails.

    ``message`` is the already-rendered whole — the caller needs it anyway for
    the payload snapshot — so the common case, which is every first attempt,
    costs one length check and no re-render at all. Only when it does not fit
    are the items packed greedily into messages, each one measured as the reader
    will receive it: header, items and AI note assembled and counted in
    Telegram's UTF-16 units. That is what the reserve-based budget it replaces
    could only estimate — the header comes from a user-editable template and the
    AI note from a language model, so both could exceed their reserve and no
    items budget could see it.

    The AI note rides on the first message only. It summarises the whole
    delivery, and repeating it under every part would cost the reader nothing
    but length.

    A digest's HEADER, by contrast, is repeated on every part and describes the
    whole digest on each — the reader is holding one digest, not three — with a
    "2/3" marker on the window line saying which slice the body under it is.
    ``items`` and ``summary_items`` are how those two halves differ: ``items``
    is the set to PACK, ``summary_items`` the whole the header DESCRIBES. They
    are the same set on a first attempt, so ``summary_items`` may be left None;
    a Telegram RESUME packs only the undelivered remainder and has to hand in
    the whole delivery, or every part of the retry summarises the remainder and
    the reader gets "9 alerts" under two earlier messages that said 24
    (tripl-0zpq.35). Deriving it from ``items`` here, as this did, silently
    undid the answer the caller had already worked out for the unsplit render.

    ``part_offset`` is how many messages of this delivery the reader ALREADY
    has from earlier attempts, and it continues the marker across them. Without
    it a resumed 24-item digest numbers its remainder "1/2", "2/2" under a "1/3"
    and "2/3" still on the reader's screen, which reads as a second digest
    rather than the rest of one. The denominator is a running total and may
    exceed what an earlier message named: "3/4" after "1/3" says the digest took
    one message more than first planned, which is true, and is the honest
    version of a count that restarts. It also means a resumed digest cannot take
    the no-re-render shortcut above — ``message`` arrived without a marker.

    Nothing is ever dropped: an item too long to share a message gets one of its
    own. A SINGLE item that alone exceeds the ceiling is the one thing this
    cannot fix — it is returned as its own message and Telegram refuses it, so
    the delivery fails visibly instead of quietly losing the item.

    receiving data past their sunset_at, or None when there are none.

    Scoped to the MAIN plan branch, for the same reason and by the same
    resolution as the event counts in :func:`_build_plan_digest_message` above:
    an open working branch deep-copies every event row and carries ``status``,
    ``sunset_at`` and ``last_seen_at`` across unchanged
    (``plan_branch_service``), so an unscoped query returns one row per branch.
    This message is the digest's "Deprecated events still receiving data" line
    expanded into named events — the first ``_SUNSET_ALERT_MAX_EVENTS`` of them,
    see below — and that line is already main-scoped, so without this predicate
    the pair disagreed about one project: the digest said 1 while the alert said
    "Count: 2" and listed the same event twice (tripl-0zpq.31).

    A project with no main branch row resolves no id, the predicate becomes
    ``branch_id IS NULL``, and ``Event.branch_id`` is NOT NULL — so the alert
    stays silent instead of listing every branch's copy. That is the right way
    to fail here: the message exists to be acted on, and one that repeats each
    event once per open branch is worse than none.

    The named list is capped and ``Count:`` is not. The count is its own
    COUNT(*) over the same predicates, so it stays the true total and stays
    equal to the digest's counter however long the list runs; the lines under it
    are a capped page of what that counted, because this message goes out daily
    to real destinations and the argument for its cap is with the constant. When
    the cap bites, the message ends in an "… and N more not shown" tail: a
    silently shortened list reads exactly like a complete one, and the list IS
