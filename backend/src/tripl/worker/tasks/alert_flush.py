"""Deliver held alerts on their destination's cadence.

A destination with ``delivery_schedule_cron`` set does not deliver after every
metrics collection. ``_prepare_alert_deliveries`` buffers its matched signals
into ``alert_pending_items`` instead, and this task turns the accumulated
buffer into ordinary ``AlertDelivery`` rows when a cron boundary passes.

The correctness argument, in one place, because it is the whole feature:

**Nothing is lost.** The buffered rows a flush ships are claimed by DELETING
them in the SAME transaction that mints the deliveries. There is no timestamp
predicate anywhere. That matters because ``created_at`` is
``server_default=func.now()`` — the INSERTing transaction's *start* clock — and
``collect_metrics`` builds buffer rows minutes before it commits. A row can
carry ``created_at = 09:00:01`` and only become visible at 09:00:20, so a flush
that selected ``created_at <= 09:00:10`` would neither see it nor ever see it
again once the next window's lower bound moved past. Claiming by row lifecycle
instead, a row that commits after the flush's snapshot is simply still
buffered, and lands in the next digest.

**Nothing is sent twice.** A row leaves the buffer exactly once, because the
DELETE and the delivery INSERT share a transaction: a rollback restores both,
a commit removes both. The window itself is claimed by a compare-and-set on
``last_flushed_at``, so a second tick — or a second worker — computing the same
fire instant gets ``rowcount == 0`` and does nothing.

That last one is a claim about a ROW. The SCOPE-level version of it needs one
more thing, because a scope can also be delivered by the IMMEDIATE path: where
``AlertRuleState.last_notified_at`` is NULL, dispatch's re-send gate fires on
the NULL regardless of cooldown, so that scope would arrive from both paths at
once. Clearing a destination's cadence therefore SPLITS its buffer, in the
transaction that clears the column
(``services._alerting_destinations.update_destination``): a row whose scope
carries that NULL is discarded there and the immediate path delivers it, while a
row whose scope a digest has already STAMPED is left for the drain arm below —
for that one the gate needs a strictly newer bucket AND an elapsed cooldown, so
the immediate path would deliver nothing and discarding it would destroy an
incident undelivered (tripl-0zpq.38).

**Everything up to the moment of sending.** The digest carries every INCIDENT
that had committed at the instant of the flush's snapshot, each with the
numbers from the most recent collection that committed by then, because the
buffer is an upsert keyed on the scope AND its direction — the five components
``_correlation_group_id`` hashes. A scope that dropped and later spiked inside
one window is two incidents and ships two lines; a scope that fired once and
went quiet still ships its line, because nothing prunes a buffered row before
its digest. "Up to the moment of sending" is a promise about the NUMBERS being
current, not that the roster is a snapshot of what is broken right now
(tripl-0zpq.108).

The advisory lock is a coarse guard against overlapping runs, deliberately NOT
the correctness argument: it is a no-op off Postgres, so the compare-and-set
and the row lifecycle have to hold on their own — and they do.
