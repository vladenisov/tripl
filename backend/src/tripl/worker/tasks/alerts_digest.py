    """Send one digest message, refusing a demo project and a disabled destination first.

    ``subject_title`` is forwarded to the channel helper, which pairs it with
    the ``[project]`` prefix to form the email subject; it defaults to the
    weekly digest's own title, so only a caller that says otherwise moves it.

    Both tasks below already leave demo projects out of their SELECT, so this
    guard is not what stops the send in practice — it is what stops a THIRD
    digest-shaped task added to this module from egressing by forgetting a
    WHERE clause. These two are the only WORKER sends that resolve a
    destination themselves instead of minting an ``AlertDelivery`` and handing
    it to a send task, so before tripl-0zpq.33 they were the only alert sends
    :func:`_assert_egress_allowed` never saw — which is why that guard's
    docstring no longer claims every dispatch path funnels through a send task,
    and names these two instead. The one other
    destination send that bypasses the send tasks is the **Test** button
    (``services/_alerting_test_send.send_destination_test``), and it stays
    outside this guard on purpose: it answers a question ABOUT a destination
    rather than delivering an alert, so it refuses a demo with an ``ok=False``
    explanation the operator can read instead of raising.

    The ENABLED toggle is re-read here too, and until tripl-0zpq.39's follow-up
    it was not checked at all: both tasks filter on ``AlertDestination.enabled``
    in their SELECT and that was taken for the guard. It is not one. Each task
    SELECTs every destination in the database up front and then loops, and each
    turn of that loop builds a message out of a dozen plan, drift and anomaly
    queries before reaching this call — so the row a send acts on was last read
    from the database as many message builds ago as there are projects ahead of
    it in the loop. An operator who switches a channel off at 09:00:02, while
    the 09:00 digest is still walking the estate, is not asking to be posted to
    at 09:00:40. :func:`alerts._assert_destination_still_enabled` is what makes
    that a re-read of the toggle rather than a re-check of the instance the
    SELECT loaded, which is a distinction with a difference here: the worker's
    sessions are ``expire_on_commit=False`` and this loop commits nothing.

    Unlike the send tasks BOTH guards run AFTER the message is built rather
    than before, and neither wants moving. These two messages are plain DB
    reads over the project's own rows, so there is no AI round-trip to be saved
    by refusing any earlier — and for the toggle, late is not a compromise but
    the point: what it is looking for is a switch thrown while the message was
    being built.

    """Alert on deprecated events that keep receiving data past their sunset_at.

    Runs daily from beat (``check-deprecated-sunset-events`` in celery_app.py,
    where the cadence is argued). It keeps no per-event state, so a project
    whose overdue list has not changed receives the same message every day
    until someone edits the PLAN — intended, not an oversight: the list IS the
    work item, and there is nothing else in the product that chases it.

    Editing the plan is the only exit, because stopping the data is not one.
    ``metrics.collect._bump_event_last_seen`` only ever moves ``last_seen_at``
    forward (documented as monotonic, and enforced by its own
    ``last_seen_at < bucket`` guard), so an event that was still receiving data
    past its sunset stays past it forever after. What clears the row is moving
    its ``status`` off ``deprecated``, clearing ``sunset_at``, or pushing
    ``sunset_at`` out beyond the data already seen.

    It reads only MAIN-branch events (:func:`_build_sunset_alert_message`), so
    its "Count:" agrees with the ``sunset_overdue`` line of the weekly digest
    above. This message is that line expanded: the count, then the first
    ``_SUNSET_ALERT_MAX_EVENTS`` events by name, then a tail saying how many it
    is not showing.

    Its email carries its own subject (``subject_title`` above). Sharing the
    send helper with the weekly digest used to mean sharing its subject too, so
    a daily alert arrived titled "Weekly tripl digest".
