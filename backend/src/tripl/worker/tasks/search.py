    WHY THIS EXISTS (tripl-uji9)
    ----------------------------
    A change to how documents are BUILT reaches a main branch on its own: the
    worker reindexes main after every scan and every metrics collection. Nothing
    does that for a working branch — it is rebuilt only when somebody edits its
    content — so a builder change split the corpus into two generations and left
    it that way.

    That is not hypothetical. Eight days after the keywords fix shipped, measured
    on production: all three main branches were correct, and eight windy-ios
    working branches still held 7117 documents built by the previous generation,
    ranking them by text the fix had already removed.

    WHAT IT COSTS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
    -----------------------------------
    The rebuild is the ordinary incremental one, so a document whose text is
    unchanged is KEPT with its vector and its embedding — it only gets its stamp
    corrected, at no provider cost. Only documents whose text genuinely moved are
    re-inserted and re-embedded, which is the work the builder change asked for.
