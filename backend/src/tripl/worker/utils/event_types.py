"""Resolve (and, when absent, create) the EventType a scanned group writes into.

Lives here rather than in ``worker.tasks.metrics.generation`` because the scan
task needs it too, and importing a metrics task module for one pure helper would
drag the whole ``collect_metrics`` task graph into ``worker.tasks.scan``'s import
path — the same reasoning that put ``reserved_columns`` in this package.

Both grouped paths go through this one function so that a manual **Run** and a
scheduled collection leave the catalog in the same state. Before tripl-0zpq.45
only the scheduled path created: a manual grouped run merely *looked up* the
event type by name and skipped the group when it was missing, so a Catalog-only
config — which by definition never reaches the scheduler — created zero events
forever, while the dry run cheerfully promised the type "would be added".

    """Why a warehouse group value cannot name an event type, or None if it can.

    The policy is REJECT, and deliberately not truncate. An event type's name is
    its IDENTITY, not display text:

    * Truncating collides. Two 120-char values that agree on their first 100
      characters become one event type, which then absorbs both groups' events
      and dedups the second group's against the first's — silently, permanently,
      and only on the values long enough to be hard to notice.
    * Truncating with a disambiguating suffix avoids the collision but breaks a
      different invariant: the name written here must equal the group value,
      because other sites look the type up BY that raw value —
      ``metrics.catalog_sync`` re-selects ``EventType.name == et_name`` for drift
      and contract detection before calling this, and the dry run does the same
      to label a type existing rather than new. A name this function reshaped
      matches none of them, so every tick would rediscover the type as new.

    So the value is validated and then stored VERBATIM — a padded ``" home "``
    stays padded — and anything that cannot be stored verbatim is refused.

    Returns the bare reason so both surfaces can use it: the run raises it as a
    ``ScanError`` (``user_facing_error`` prefixes "Scan failed:"), and the dry
    run appends it to ``errors`` unprefixed, the way it already reports a
    ``NameFormatError`` it will not fail the preview over.
