def reserved_catalog_columns(config: ScanConfig) -> set[str]:
    """Scan columns that are metric dimensions or identity, not tracked event fields.

    The event-type/time grouping columns and the app-version & platform breakdown
    columns are collected into metric tables (EventMetric / EventMetricBreakdown),
    never the catalog. Excluding them from FieldDefinition creation keeps them off
    the events table, where they'd otherwise show up as useless columns carrying
    non-deterministic per-event sample values. Event-group-rule columns join them
    for the same reason — see ``_event_group_rule_columns``.

    Two consumers, both catalog-facing:

    * ``catalog_sync`` takes it as ``skip_columns`` (no FieldDefinition is created)
    * ``generate_events`` takes it as ``reserved_columns`` and stays quiet about a
      reserved column having no FieldDefinition — of course it has none, that is
      this function's doing, and reporting it as a plan gap sent a fresh demo's
      very first scan out with six of seven detail lines wrong (tripl-jfm3.90)

    It deliberately does NOT feed ``check_scalar_columns_unreserved`` — a project
    that already selected a group-rule column as a breakdown keeps working.

    Columns named by ``event_name_format`` are subtracted last and win over every
    rule above. Reserving one is not a cosmetic mistake: ``catalog_sync`` forwards
    this set as ``skip_columns``, so the column gets no FieldDefinition, and
    ``generate_events`` builds its format arguments only from columns that have
    one. The name format is then evaluated with the placeholder missing and the
    whole collection dies on ``the event name format references unknown keys``. That
    is what took production's 'Old events (iOS)' scan down for 200 consecutive
    runs (tripl-lpin): its group rules match ``action`` and its name format is
    ``{action}``, so tripl-jfm3.90 reserved away the one column the event's
    identity was built from.

    A DOTTED placeholder is subtracted by its BASE column, which is why this
    subtracts ``name_format_base_columns`` and not the full placeholder keys.
    ``{event.category}`` is walked out of the ``event`` column's JSON, and
    ``generate_events`` assembles ``col.path`` keys only for columns that reached
    ``col_meta`` — i.e. that have a FieldDefinition. Subtracting the full key
    ``event.category`` from a set of top-level column names removes nothing, so a
    config whose ``platform_column`` is ``event`` kept ``event`` reserved and
    reproduced tripl-lpin from the other direction: same outage, same message,
    reached through a placeholder shape the subtraction could not see.

    That base reduction belongs to the SUBTRACTION and nowhere else. A group-rule
    condition the config declares to be a JSON value path is dropped WHOLE rather
    than reduced, because reducing on the additive side reserves a column nobody
    asked to reserve; the argument is at the guard in ``_event_group_rule_columns``.
    What both halves buy is one invariant: this function never invents a name the
    config did not write. Every key it returns is either a column the config names
    or a rule's condition field verbatim — a dotted one included, since a dotted
    warehouse column is real — and never a base column derived from a longer key.
