"""Who is allowed to close a ``ScanJob``, and how a running worker finds out.

Lives in ``worker.utils`` rather than in ``worker.tasks.metrics._helpers``
because both the scan tasks and ``collect_metrics`` need it, and importing a
metrics task module from ``worker.tasks.scan`` would drag the whole
``collect_metrics`` task graph into that module's import path — the same
reasoning that put ``event_types`` and ``reserved_columns`` in this package.

``worker.tasks.metrics._helpers`` still *declares* a ``TERMINAL_SCAN_JOB_STATUSES``
of its own because that name sits in its published ``__all__`` and removing it is
a wider change than this one. It has no production consumer left — the task
module imports this copy — and ``test_batch3_a3`` pins the two equal so the
leftover cannot drift.
