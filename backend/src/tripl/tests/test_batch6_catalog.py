"""Batch 6, lane A: the metric catalog service, its schemas and its router.

Each defect is pinned by an assertion that goes red the moment the production
change is reverted:

* tripl-0zpq.171 — a metric saved before a config key existed compared UNEQUAL
  to its own unchanged definition, because ``to_definition_values()`` fills in
  today's defaults while the check compared raw stored dicts. Editing only the
  description of such a metric — the form always resends the definition —
  deleted every value, breakdown and anomaly it had collected.
* tripl-0zpq.172 — that same clear could run while a collection was in flight.
  The worker holds the old definition in locals, so it kept writing old buckets
  into the cleared series and then stamped a watermark over them, and the NULL
  status it left behind released the one-active-job guard.
* tripl-0zpq.175 — every metric created through the form landed on order 0, and
  reorder only permuted the order values it found, so a permutation of equal
  values wrote nothing: drag-to-reorder never persisted, and a duplicated id in
  the request was an ``IndexError`` 500.
* tripl-0zpq.178 — ``active_total`` searched a different population than the
  rows it sits above: name/display_name only, against a stripped term, while
  the list also searched descriptions with the raw one.
* tripl-0zpq.179 — deleting a metric left its catalog-scope anomalies behind
  forever. They carry no FK, and every other purge finds anomalies through the
  ids of metrics that still exist.
* tripl-0zpq.180 — a broker outage put the whole collection group into the error
  state by assigning the two columns by hand, bypassing ``mark_collection_error``
  and leaving ``last_collection_failed_at`` unstamped, so the dispatcher's
  post-error cooldown measured from unrelated history.
* tripl-0zpq.238 — ``POST /metrics/bulk-update`` recorded nothing, so a bulk
  archive was the one mutation in its group invisible in the Audit log.
* tripl-0zpq.239 — the duplicate-id ``IndexError`` 500 in reorder, which is the
  same defect ``tripl-0zpq.175`` covers above and shares its test.
* tripl-0zpq.241 — ``metric_definition.collect`` was filed with an empty
  ``target_name``, so the row named no metric.
* tripl-0zpq.354 — the data-source scope refusal claimed the row was missing on
  anti-enumeration grounds that the workspace-wide list route already gives away.
* tripl-0zpq.89 — a denominator could be parked on a ``single`` /
  ``per_distinct_user`` composition metric, where the collector never reads it.
  Dead config, until an event merge made the two operands equal and the merge
  guard put the metric in the error state with a message about a constant-1.0
  ratio, although it is a plain count and still collects correctly.
* tripl-0zpq.173 — a sql metric whose outer projection does not name the time
  column saved with 201 and then failed EVERY collection, reported as "Scan
  failed due to an internal error." because the worker's refusal is a bare
  ``ValueError``.
* tripl-0zpq.174 — fact-metric breakdown / app_version / platform columns were
  never checked against the fact table. One typo failed the whole metric on every
  tick, top-line series included, because the assembly loop re-raises a breakdown
  scan's error before writing anything.
* tripl-0zpq.270 — catalog ``breakdown_columns`` were not deduplicated, unlike
  every sibling scalar-column field. A repeated column made the Postgres upsert
  hit the same conflict key twice in one statement.
* tripl-0zpq.347 — the data-source scoping rule lived inline in the async save
  path, so the collector could not apply it to an already-stored row.

    ``data_source_out_of_project_scope`` is the ownership decision as a pure
    function of the three facts both paths have, so the two cannot drift — a
    predicate that means one thing on save and another on collect is exactly the
    shape of the defect this came from.

    The collector half landed with the extraction: ``metric_collect._collect_sql``
    calls ``metric_collect._reject_foreign_data_source`` on the stored
    ``data_source_id`` right after it resolves the row and before it builds the
    adapter, so a cross-project id written before the save-time check existed now
    fails its collection loudly instead of running under the foreign credential.

    WHAT IS STILL UNTESTED is that collector half: these cases cover the pure
    predicate and the save door that consults it, in an async API test. Pinning

        A bare ``assert resp.status_code == 404`` would certify nothing here — the
        inline check this extraction replaced refused the identical case with the
        identical status. So the refusal is tied to the shared module's own
        sentence, and then the shared module's own predicate is REPLACED: a router
        that keeps refusing while the function it supposedly calls says "in scope"
        is a router carrying its own copy of the rule, which is the drift
        tripl-0zpq.347 is about.
