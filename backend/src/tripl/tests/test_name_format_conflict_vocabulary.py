"""The shared 409 is rendered verbatim in the web UI, so it speaks the web UI's nouns.

``name_format_conflict_detail`` writes ONE sentence for three delete doors and
three clients: the web UI, ``tripl drifts accept``, and the MCP server. The web
UI renders it untouched — ``api/client.ts`` puts the ``detail`` string into
``ApiError.message`` and ``EventTypesTab``/``EventDriftBadge`` drop that straight
into a ``role="alert"`` — so whatever is written here is UI copy, whoever else
also reads it.

That is a blind spot in the frontend's own vocabulary guard, and the reason this
file lives on the backend side. ``frontend/src/scan-docs-agreement.test.ts``
enforces the tripl-3y7z settlement (the web UI says *scan* and *run*; the wire
keeps ``scan_config`` and ``job``) by reading string literals and JSX text out of
frontend sources. A sentence assembled in Python has no literal there to find, so
"1 scan config(s)" sat in a ``role="alert"`` through the whole epic that banned
it (tripl-24i0).

Rather than copy the frontend's rule into a Python literal — two copies of a rule
is how the rule ends up enforcing two different things, and that pattern has
already been widened once, for the "configuration" spelling — this reads
``SCAN_CONFIG_NOUN`` out of the frontend guard and applies it to the string the
backend builds. Parsing TypeScript from a Python test is ugly; it is less ugly
than a second, quieter definition of the same ban. Same shape as
``test_alert_template_mirror`` and ``test_cli_constant_mirror``.

**Scope is the sentence this helper authors.** The ``lead`` and ``then`` clauses
are the callers' words, passed in from ``field_service``, ``schema_drift_service``
and ``plan_branch_merge_service``, and the same rule applies to them — but the
only way to assert on them here is to restate the literals, and a restated
literal drifts from the call site in exactly the way this whole module exists to
prevent. They are short, they name an action, and none of them names this record
at all.
