"""Batch 5, scan preview: nested warehouse values and JSON path discovery.

``tripl-0zpq.94`` — a preview payload must be ``json.dumps``-able with the
stdlib encoder, because ``ScanPreviewJob.result_summary`` is ``sa.JSON`` and the
worker's sync engine registers no ``json_serializer``. Only the TOP level of
each cell was ever checked, so a ``datetime`` inside a ClickHouse
``Array(DateTime)`` or ``Map(String, DateTime)`` reached ``json.dumps`` intact
and raised ``TypeError`` at commit — surfacing to the operator as "Scan failed
due to an internal error." There are two distinct routes into that failure
(with and without the diversity pass) and one test per route below.

``tripl-0zpq.99`` — JSON path discovery used to wrap the adapter call in
``except AttributeError`` and fall back to sampling rows locally. Every adapter
inherits a concrete ``BaseAdapter.get_json_path_samples``, so the only thing
that except could still catch was an AttributeError raised inside an adapter,
which it answered with a different, worse result reported as success.

No live warehouse and no database: the adapters are hand-written fakes and the
payload builders are called directly.
