"""Reverting a branch change against an older base or an awkward name (tripl-0zpq batch 2).

- tripl-0zpq.147: the revert reads the base snapshot the way the diff reads it,
  through ``with_snapshot_defaults``. A base taken before a key joined v2 has no
  such key; the diff shows the default as the base value, so the revert has to
  put back that default — not ``None``.
- tripl-0zpq.150: the successor pointer is stored as ``"<type>.<name>"`` and is
  resolved by spelling that key back whole. Dotted names resolve, and a key two
  branch events answer to is a 409 rather than a guess or a 500 — as is a key
  two BASE events answered to. The event being reverted is never its own
  successor, though it can spell the key itself.
- review2#18: rebuilding a deleted event puts its successor back, resolved the
  way the field revert resolves it — including both 409s.
- Namesakes (tripl-0zpq.149, cut back): a branch copy does not record which base
  row it came from, so when several base rows answer to the key a change or a
  removal names, the revert is a 409 rather than a restore from an arbitrary
  one of them.
- tripl-0zpq.155: an event's type is part of its diff key, never a changed
  field, so there is no ``event_type_name`` for the revert to restore.
- A merged branch cannot be reopened, so its refusal does not say to reopen it.
