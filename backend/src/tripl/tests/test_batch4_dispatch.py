"""Batch 4, the dispatch lane: seven defects around the alert write path.

tripl-0zpq.109 — the alert link base URL is resolved once, not once per link.
tripl-0zpq.253 — every scope label fits the column it is stored in.
tripl-0zpq.260 — the incident handle is documented as the thing it is.
tripl-0zpq.157 — loading a scan config does not load its whole scan history.
tripl-0zpq.28  — a metric scope's STATE and buffered rows store no scan config.
tripl-0zpq.27  — and its incident HANDLE hashes no scan config either.
tripl-0zpq.108 — the digest buffer holds one line per INCIDENT, and says so.

The last three carry their write-ups at their own section headers below rather
than here, because each pins a single connected argument and reading it beside
the tests is worth more than reading it four hundred lines above them.

## tripl-0zpq.109

``app_base_url`` used to be read back out of the database inside every URL
builder in ``worker/tasks/metrics/urls.py``. ``get_runtime_config_sync`` has no
cache, and called with no session it checks out a SECOND pooled connection and
runs two ``app_settings`` SELECTs. ``_build_item_paths`` runs twice per alert
item — once for the typed ``AlertDeliveryItem`` row, once for the frozen
``payload_snapshot`` — so an ordinary item cost three of those reads and a
24-item digest cost 48-72, all of them taken while ``alert_flush._build_digest``
held FOR UPDATE locks on the whole buffer and the flush advisory lock on the
first connection.

Two properties are pinned below, because the fix has two halves:

* COUNT. ``dispatch._create_deliveries`` reads the runtime config exactly once,
  on the session it was handed, however many items the delivery carries.
* AGREEMENT. The read is fallible by design — ``get_runtime_config_sync``
  swallows every exception and falls back to the env config, whose
  ``app_base_url`` defaults to ``""`` — so independent reads let one delivery
  disagree with itself about the same item's link. This is the same class of
  defect ``alert_payload._build_delivery_snapshot`` already carries a long
  comment about for ``percent_delta``; here it is the links.

## tripl-0zpq.253

``scope_name`` is VARCHAR(255) on ``alert_delivery_items``,
``alert_pending_items`` and ``anomaly_scope_overrides``, and its sources are
wider: ``Event.name`` is String(500), and the drift scopes append ``.{field}``
to an event or event-type name, so they overflow even when the name alone does
not. An alert for an event named over 255 characters failed its INSERT on
Postgres, and with no savepoint around ``_prepare_alert_deliveries`` that rolled
back the whole collection — anomaly recalculation, cooldown state and every
delivery for every scope of that scan config — on every tick, for as long as the
anomaly stayed active.

The Postgres ``DataError`` itself is unreachable here: the suite runs on SQLite,
which ignores ``VARCHAR(n)`` entirely. What is pinned instead is the invariant
behind it — what lands in the row fits the column — the way
``test_batch3_d1.py`` pins the same shape one table over. Every test below also
asserts that its fixture genuinely overflows, so none of them can quietly stop
exercising the bug if someone shortens a name.

## tripl-0zpq.260

``AlertDeliveryItem.correlation_group_id`` was documented as a per-delivery
co-firing tag, NULL when an item fired alone. It is neither: the id is a stable
per-incident handle, it is written on every item, and the whole alert inbox is
built on it. Code written from the old comment would label every alert
"correlated" and group unrelated deliveries together.

A comment fix has no runtime edge to catch, so one guard below asserts the two
replaced sentences are gone and that the block NAMES the owner of the key
rather than restating it — restating it is how it went stale in the first
place. What keeps that guard from being a spell-check is the three tests beside
it, which pin every claim the new text makes: the key carries no bucket and
splits per scope, the mint is unconditional, and a delivery carrying exactly
one item still gets a handle the inbox can see.

## tripl-0zpq.157

``ScanConfig.scan_jobs`` was declared ``lazy="selectin"``, so loading a
ScanConfig ENTITY — as opposed to its columns — pulled in every scan job that
config had ever run, each with a JSON ``result_summary`` and an
``error_message``. Nothing reads the collection; it exists for the ORM delete
cascade. The alert inbox is the caller this issue was filed against
(``_INBOX_GROUP_SELECT`` selects the entity for its ``name``, at four call
sites), but the scheduler pays it on every beat tick for every scheduled
config, and so do ``alert_flush``, the Scans tab and search.

What makes it a defect rather than a waste is that the collection is
UNBOUNDED: a row per collection, pruned only for demo projects, so the cost
grows with deployment age x cadence forever.

The two halves are pinned separately, because a fix for one can break the
other. The eager load is gone (no ``scan_jobs`` round trip on either the plain
entity load or the real inbox query), AND the cascade still works — asserted
on a factory with FK enforcement OFF, so the ORM's own child DELETE is the
only thing that can empty the table. A source scan stands behind the "nothing
reads it" premise, since a lazy load on the async path does not merely cost a
query, it raises.

No network, and the DB is a throwaway sqlite file.

# shipped, and the abandoned row stayed ``is_active=True`` forever. Deleting the
# anchor did the same through ON DELETE CASCADE, and took the undelivered digest
# lines with it.

# by the digest, not skipped by its ``config is None`` guard and then deleted as
# claimed. That is the assertion to gate a revert on — it is the one place in
# this change that can destroy an alert silently and permanently.

# tripl-0zpq.27: the metric scope's INCIDENT HANDLE hashes no scan config either
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# tripl-0zpq.28 moved a metric scope's STATE row and its BUFFERED row onto a NULL
# scan config. This is the third copy of the same identity, and the one left
# behind: ``_prepare_alert_deliveries`` built ``correlation_by_anomaly`` in one
# unconditional loop over ``config.id``, so ``_correlation_group_id`` hashed the
# FIRING scan even for a scope that belongs to no scan.
#
# A project with three scans — ``windy-ios`` runs three — therefore minted THREE
# incident handles for one project-wide catalog metric. That is not cosmetic:
# ``suppressed_group_ids`` is a set of these ids and is the entire mechanism
# behind an Inbox acknowledgement or mute. Acknowledge the handle scan A
# delivered and scan B's next collection computes one that is not in the set,
# sends anyway, and opens an AlertCorrelationState of its own — the operator's
# decision silently bypassed, and one incident listed in the Inbox up to N times
# against a user guide that promises one row per incident.
#
# The release path carried the mirror of it. ``_reopen_closed_incidents`` takes
# ONE partition per call and rebuilds the ids itself, while ``closed_keys`` can
# hold metric and non-metric scopes together, so the call is split in two.
#
# The rule implemented is the one tripl-0zpq.28 established everywhere else:
# HASH THE PARTITION THE ROW ACTUALLY STORES. ``_scope_partition_id`` is the one
# answer for all three copies, and ``_correlation_group_id`` renders its NULL
# through a non-UUID literal so the project-global id space is provably disjoint

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# tripl-0zpq.108: a scope that flips direction ships one line per INCIDENT,
# and the prose finally says so
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``_buffer_pending_items`` promised that "a scope firing all day still occupies
# exactly one line" while the buffer's key ends in ``direction``. So a scope that
# DROPS at 03:00 and SPIKES at 11:00 buffers two rows and the daily digest
# carries both. The mechanism is real, current and common rather than a corner:
# 106 of 223 live scopes fired in BOTH directions inside one day
# (``models/alert_rule``).
#
# What is NOT real is the "one of them is stale" framing, or either remedy the
# issue proposed. ``direction`` is in the buffer key because it is in the
# INCIDENT: ``_correlation_group_id`` is "one rule, one scope, one direction",
# ``AlertPendingItem.correlation_group_id`` is ONE non-null column, and the user
# guide promises the Inbox is one row per incident. Both remedies break that.
#
#   * DROP ``direction`` from ``uq_alert_pending_item_scope`` and one row stands
#     for two incidents while naming only one of them. ``_build_digest`` filters
#     on exactly that value, so the surviving handle either swallows the
#     incident nobody acknowledged or ignores the acknowledgement that was made.
#   * DELETE the sibling on a flip and an incident that was buffered is
#     destroyed before it was ever delivered, and nothing re-offers it:
#     ``AlertRuleState`` has no direction column, so the flipped scope is
#     already reusing that one state row, and ``last_notified_at`` is stamped
#     only on a SENT delivery.
#
# This section therefore changes no behaviour. It pins the behaviour that was
# always right and that nothing tested — reverting to ``config.id``-style
# collapse broke not one test in the repo before these — and it pins the four
# prose sites that had gone false around it. Each test names the line it dies
# on.

# 03:00 drops, 11:00 spikes: the filed scenario's two collections, inside one
# daily window.
