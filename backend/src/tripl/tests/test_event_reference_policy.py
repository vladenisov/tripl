"""What happens to a reference when the event it names goes away.

``core.event_references`` is the shared half of two opposite executors: a group
merge re-points a reference onto the surviving event, a delete drops it. These
tests are pure — no session, no database — because the decisions are pure, and
the one that matters is not obvious.

The alert-filter rule is the sharp edge. Getting it wrong does not lose a row,
it silently INVERTS a rule: an emptied ``in`` filter matches NOTHING and an
emptied ``not_in`` filter matches EVERYTHING. That truth table is asserted
against ``alerting_matching`` itself rather than restated here as a comment, so
the policy stays pinned to the matcher it reasons about.
