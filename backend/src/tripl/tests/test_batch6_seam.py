"""Batch 6, seam lane: the three defects that span two lanes' files.

* tripl-0zpq.177 — one question, two answers. The ``sql``-metric doors decided
  which data source a project may use by OWNERSHIP; the fact-table doors demanded
  a ``ScanConfig`` in the project. Both are now the ownership rule in
  ``services/data_source_scope``, which WIDENS the fact-table doors: a
  workspace-global warehouse nobody scans is shared, and reachable from every
  project. That is a deliberate decision, and the tests below say so out loud.
* tripl-0zpq.353 — the same misconfiguration answered 400 on the fact-table
  preview door and 404 on the three others, with two different sentences, inside
  one wizard flow. All four now answer 404 with one sentence.
* tripl-0zpq.181 — an explicit ``null`` on a PATCH field whose column is NOT NULL
  reached the database and came back as a blank 500. It is a 422 naming the
  field, on the metric PATCH, the metric bulk-update and the fact-table PATCH.

Each assertion is written so that reverting the production change turns it red;
where that is not obvious from the assertion, the docstring says how.
