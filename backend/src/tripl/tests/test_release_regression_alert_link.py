"""What a release-regression alert links to, and what its line claims.

The trigger was a real alert:

    - Release regression spot:open:wind: down, actual=345, expected=715.7,
      delta=370.7 (51.8%)
      release: dropped in 15.7.5 (was 15.7.4)
      details: https://tripl.windyapp.co/p/windy-ios/monitoring/event/c36b3ba...

Two defects, both the product's fault:

(a) The link opened the event's monitoring page, which charts the event across
    ALL versions over the chart's own range against the seasonal baseline. The
    alert's numbers come from one release's cohort over the activation-anchored
    rollout-overlap window. Different numerator, denominator, window and
    estimator — the page could not corroborate the alert even in principle.

(b) The line never said what it measured, so ``expected=715.7`` read as a raw
    count and the obvious reply was "so what if it's lower, the release only
    just rolled out". That objection is exactly what the normalization already
    removes.

(c) Fixing (a) over-reached: the audit link was handed to variable value drift
    as well, which cost that scope a working event link and gained it a page
    showing strictly less than the message. Section (c) below re-derives the
    membership rule scope by scope and pins it.

These tests are pure: no DB, no network. The URL builders are exercised through
a stubbed runtime config.

# renders a fixed 8 columns — Grp / Scope / Direction / Actual / Expected /
# Abs delta / % delta / Link (frontend AlertDeliveryRow.tsx) — and none of them
# is ``drift_field`` or ``sample_value``. For a drift scope those two fields
# ARE the finding, so sending a drift item there shows less than the message
# the reader is already holding.
#
# It is an upgrade for exactly one scope: release regression, whose numbers no
# page can reproduce. So the rule is a last resort, not a default:
#
#     link an item to the audit row only when NO page shows more than
#     the message does.
#
# Scope by scope, as of this test:
#
#   project_total / event_type / event / metric
#       Have their own monitoring pages, computed the same way the alert was.
#       Never audit-linked.
#   variable_value_drift
#       ``VariableValueDrift.event_id`` is NOT NULL, and
#       ``/p/{slug}/monitoring/event/{event_id}`` mounts EventValueDriftPanel
#       (MonitoringDetailPage.tsx), which lists the variable name, EVERY
#       observed value — not the 500-char truncation the message sends — and
#       the Accept / Accept for event / Snooze / False positive actions.
#       Strictly more than both the audit row and the message. Never
#       audit-linked.
#   schema / distribution
#       Carry ``event_type_id`` and a NULL ``event_id``, so no event link
#       exists to build, and their scope_ref is a drift row / field key that
#       no route accepts. They get no link at all, which is honest; the audit
