"""Guards for the shape of a project lookup (tripl-jfm3.54).

``Project.event_types`` / ``meta_field_definitions`` / ``relations`` /
``variables`` used to be declared ``lazy="selectin"``, so resolving a slug to a
project pulled the project's ENTIRE tracking plan into the session — four extra
round trips and, on the largest production project, ~1300 Variable rows — even
for handlers that only wanted ``project.id``. That is what made three
constant-size settings endpoints 4-7x slower on big projects than on small ones.

Two things have to stay true for that fix to hold:

* a slug lookup emits ONE select, and
* deleting a project still removes its plan (the collections exist purely for
  that ORM-level cascade, so making them lazy must not strand rows).
