"""A distribution drift the dispatcher would skip is not readiness (tripl-0zpq.166).

``load_scope_readiness`` answers "has this project any source data for this scope
at all", and the distribution half answered it by counting ANY collected
``DistributionDrift`` row. Every scored bucket is persisted, stable and minor
included (``metric_rows`` bands each PSI and writes them all), nothing prunes
them, and the only candidate builder selects the significant band — so a project
that watched a column for months without ever crossing the threshold, then
cleared ``distribution_drift_fields``, was told its scope was fine while nothing
could ever feed it again. The value-drift half of the same query has mirrored its
builder's filters since tripl-wkwv.1; this is the missing symmetry.

Both ends are pinned here, because the mirror can be broken from either side:
the probe, through the endpoint the Alerting tab polls, and
``_get_active_distribution_drift_candidates``, called on a sync session the way
the worker calls it. Fixtures are shared with the tests that own them rather than
forked — ``test_alerting_scope_readiness`` for the async project/scan/readiness
helpers, ``test_metrics_tasks`` for the sync scan-config seed.
