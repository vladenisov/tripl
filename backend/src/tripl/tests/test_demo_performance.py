"""Demo provisioning performance budgets (epic tripl-2su6.10).

Guards against a silent cost regression — e.g. a builder switching from batched
``add_all`` to per-row inserts, or an accidental N+1. The budgets are generous
relative to the measured cost (~190 statements, a few seconds here) so they pass
reliably on CI-sized hardware while still catching a multiple-x regression.
