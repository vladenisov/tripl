"""Batch 4, cross-lane: three fixes whose reporter could not reach the file.

Each of the three was found while fixing something else, in a module the finder
did not own, and each lands in a different layer — a service, a demo seeder, a
schema. They are together here because that is the one thing they have in
common; nothing in this file shares a fixture with anything else in it.

``tripl-0zpq.37`` (service lane) — the Inbox **Retry** button has to hand the
send task a CLAIMABLE row. The single-flight lease that fix added refuses a
delivery whose ``claimed_at`` is newer than ``STRANDED_DELIVERY_MINUTES``, and
``retry_delivery`` flips a `failed` row back to `pending` without clearing it.
The reaper's failed arm — the only other failed -> pending flip in the system —
does clear it, and says why: the hand-off must not depend on the send path's own
release having run. This is defence in depth rather than a live bug, and the
test says which: see ``test_retry_hands_the_send_task_a_row_it_can_claim``.

``tripl-0zpq.253`` (demo lane) — ``scope_name`` is a String(255) fed by wider
sources, and ``demo.builders.alerts`` was the last writer family outside the
trim the rest of the batch installed.

``tripl-v422`` (schema lane) — a per-destination From: override that every
reader of the column would happily deliver could not be SAVED, because the save
used the strict validator and the send paths use ``validate_sender_address``.
The mirror image of ``tripl-0zpq.29``, which fixed the same disagreement at the
other end of the same pipe.

    """Retry must not report success over a send that cannot happen.

    ``alerts._claim_delivery`` is a compare-and-set that refuses a `pending` row
    whose ``claimed_at`` is newer than ``STRANDED_DELIVERY_MINUTES``. Retry flips
    the row to `pending`, resets the attempt budget and enqueues the task — so a
    lease left behind turns that ``.delay()`` into a silent no-op: the API
    answers 200, the Inbox shows `pending`, and nothing goes out until the lease
    ages out fifteen minutes later.

    The final assertion is the real one and it runs the real claim rather than
    re-deriving the rule: delete ``delivery.claimed_at = None`` from
    ``services/_alerting_deliveries.retry_delivery`` and ``_claim_delivery``
    returns False here, with the two assertions above it still passing — which
    is precisely why this is worth a test. It is the same assertion, on the same
    line of reasoning, that ``test_alerting`` makes for the reaper's failed arm;
    the two flips have to agree.

    NOT a live bug today, and the fix is not sold as one. Every send path
    releases its own lease when the attempt ends (``alerts.py`` on both
    branches, ``alert_digest_send.py`` on all three), and the one write that
    marks a row `failed` without going through a send — the reaper's exhaustion
    relabel — can only ever see an EXPIRED lease, because ``claimed_at`` is set
    by the same UPDATE that bumps ``updated_at`` and that arm selects on
    ``updated_at < now - STRANDED_DELIVERY_MINUTES``. So the row seeded here is
    reachable only through a crash or a write that predates the column. Clearing
    it unconditionally is what makes the hand-off independent of that release
    having run, which is the reason ``maintenance.py`` gives for its own copy.
