"""The PostgreSQL-only advisory locks, run against PostgreSQL (tripl-r6ec).

Every one of these guards is a no-op on the SQLite the suite runs on, by design
and said so at each site, so a wrong dialect string or a dropped lock call used
to ship green. These tests hold them on a real database and look from a SECOND
session — through ``pg_try_advisory_xact_lock`` and ``pg_locks`` — to prove the
lock is really taken and really released:

* ``auth_service.acquire_owner_set_xact_lock``, which serialises the first-owner
  registration (and the last-owner demotion) — with the race it exists for;
* ``metric_definition_service._try_acquire_metric_dispatch_transaction_lock``,
  the manual-collect side of the catalog scheduler's advisory lock — with the
  409 a manual collect answers while the scheduler holds it.

Branch-merge locking is covered by ``test_batch18_merge_races_pg``. Like every
PostgreSQL gate here these skip without ``TRIPL_TEST_PG_URL`` and fail when
``TRIPL_TEST_PG_REQUIRED=1`` finds no database (``test_alert_digest_concurrency_pg``).
