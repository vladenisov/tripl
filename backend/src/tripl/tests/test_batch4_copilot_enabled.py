"""The disabled-destination window, measured where it actually is.

tripl-0zpq.39 put ``_assert_destination_enabled`` into the two send tasks and
that closed the case it was filed for: a delivery minted at 09:00 against an
enabled destination, switched off at 09:05, redispatched by the reaper at 09:15.
``test_batch4_send.py`` pins that case, and it flips the toggle BEFORE the task
runs — so the check at the top of the task is enough to make it pass.

Copilot's review of PR #169 pointed out what that leaves open. The check sits at
the top of the task and the egress is 130 to 400 lines below it, with the AI
round-trip, the sparkline and top-mover warehouse reads and the template render
in between; the scheduled-digest sender is worse, because it renders and commits
EVERY member of the batch before the first outbound call. And the helper both
beat-scheduled digests use (``alerts_digest._send_digest_to_destination``) had no
enabled check at all — its two tasks SELECT every enabled destination in the
database up front and then loop, building a dozen queries' worth of message per
project before sending.

So every test here flips the toggle DURING that window — from inside the render
the task is running — which is the only shape of the bug the earlier tests
cannot see. Each one names the line whose revert reddens it.

One mechanism is shared by all of them and is worth stating once. The flip is
issued on the TASK'S OWN session, as a Core UPDATE with
``synchronize_session=False``:

* Not from a second connection, because sqlite serializes writers and the send
  task holds an open write transaction from the moment it flushes its claim —
  a second connection would block on that lock for pysqlite's timeout instead of
  racing the render, which is a hang, not a test.
* ``synchronize_session=False`` because the point is the STALENESS. It leaves
  the ``AlertDestination`` instance the task is holding still reading
  ``enabled=True`` while the row behind it reads disabled, which is exactly what
  a ``PATCH /alert-destinations/{id}`` committed on another connection leaves
  behind — worker sessions are ``expire_on_commit=False`` (worker/db.py), so
  nothing in these tasks would notice on its own. That staleness is the whole
  reason the second check has to RE-READ; re-calling
  ``_assert_destination_enabled`` on the instance already in hand would return
  the answer the first call got and could never disagree with it.
