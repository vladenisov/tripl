"""Zero-outbound-network guarantees for the demo ``demo_sink`` alert path.

The single invariant this suite protects: a demo project's alerting — create,
tick/dispatch, simulate and retry — must never make an outbound network call.
A hard guard replaces ``socket.socket`` (and, defensively, ``httpx`` sends and
``smtplib.SMTP``) with a tripwire that raises on any use, so if a demo alert path
ever tried to send, the exercised call would fail loudly instead of silently
"succeeding".
