"""Batch 5, lane W5-demopause: a PAUSED demo must not be collected (tripl-0zpq.72).

``advance_demos`` already skips a demo nobody has opened for
``DEMO_IDLE_PAUSE_MINUTES``. The metrics dispatcher did not, and the two together
destroyed history: with the tick paused the demo's newest ``EventMetric`` bucket
stops moving, so ``collection_progress_to`` — the point the collector resumes
from — freezes with it and the next scheduled collection opens a window spanning
the whole demo cooldown plus the two-bucket resume overlap. The synthetic
warehouse behind every demo only materialises its newest
``SYNTHETIC_ONGOING_HOURS`` at full volume, and the collector deletes each chunk
window before rewriting it, so every run replaced the hours beyond that reach
with sampled near-zero counts.

These tests pin the gate itself (skip while paused, dispatch on access), that it
is demo-only, that it is measured before the cooldown's job-history read, and
that the tick and the dispatcher ask ONE predicate rather than two that can drift.
