"""PostgreSQL wiring for the search-relevance harness (tripl-338u).

WHY A SECOND DATABASE AT ALL
----------------------------
The backend suite runs on in-memory SQLite (``tests/conftest.py``), and search
carries a Python fallback (``_search_query.sqlite_search``) for exactly that
reason. So the production ranking SQL — ``ts_rank_cd``, the trigram tiers, the
``tripl_search`` text-search configuration, ``merge_results`` — has never once
been executed by a test, and every weight in it is unfalsifiable. Nothing short
of a real PostgreSQL can execute it.

TWO RULES, BORROWED FROM THE CONFORMANCE GATES
----------------------------------------------
**A developer without Docker must not be blocked.** An unreachable server SKIPS,
so ``uv run pytest`` on a laptop stays green and the SQLite suite is unaffected.

**CI must not be allowed to skip.** ``TRIPL_RELEVANCE_REQUIRED=1`` (CI sets it)
turns "server unreachable" into a hard FAILURE, and the CI job additionally
asserts from the JUnit XML that tests actually ran and that none of them skipped
for real. A gate that silently no-ops reports green while testing nothing.

WHY ALEMBIC AND NOT ``Base.metadata.create_all``
------------------------------------------------
``create_all`` would give a schema, but it would NOT give the object under test.
``tripl_search`` is created by a migration, and it was created as
``COPY = simple`` — i.e. with no stemming — which was itself one of the faults the
harness is here to pin (see :mod:`tripl.tests.relevance.cases`, fault B). A
hand-rolled configuration in this file would have tested a copy of the bug, and
the migration that fixed it would not have flipped a single assertion here.
Running the real revision chain is what makes "the fix landed" and "the harness
went green" the same event — and that is not hypothetical any more: fault B was
fixed by ``a7c3e1b9d5f2``, a migration and nothing but a migration, so the four
cases it flipped are green here only because this fixture runs ``alembic upgrade
head``. It also gets ``pgvector`` and ``pg_trgm`` set up the way production has
them, which is why the CI service container is the pgvector image rather than
stock postgres.
