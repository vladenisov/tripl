"""Only a document that IS what was typed may be painted as certain (tripl-d5u8).

WHY THIS NEEDS A REAL POSTGRESQL, AND WHY THE BACKEND SUITE CANNOT HOST IT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The defect lived entirely in the Postgres score. ``_FULL_CONFIDENCE_SCORE`` was
derived as ``5.0`` (exact title) ``+ 2.0`` (a perfect trigram on that same
title), and confidence was that fraction of the TOTAL — but the total also
carries ``lexical_score * 4.0`` and, since tripl-9t2s, ``COVERAGE_BONUS``.
Neither was in the derivation, so documents that are not the thing named crossed
the line anyway.

On SQLite that could never happen: ``fallback_score`` returns ONE tier value per
document and never sums evidence, and only its two equality tiers sit at or above
the line. So the guarantee the whole backend suite was verifying was one the
dialect users actually search on did not provide. That is why this file is here
and not in ``tests/test_search.py``.

THREE ASSERTIONS, AND THE FIRST IS WHAT MAKES THE OTHERS MEAN ANYTHING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
"No result reports 1.0" is satisfied by a great many broken states — a
confidence stuck at zero, a cap applied to everything, a query that returned
nothing. So this file also asserts that an exact title DOES still reach 1.0.
Without that control, deleting the confidence calculation entirely would leave
this file green.

The same shape as :mod:`tripl.tests.relevance.test_coverage_invariants`, and for
the same reason.
