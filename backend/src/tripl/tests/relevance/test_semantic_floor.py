"""Executable coverage for the semantic leg's cosine floor (tripl-txcz).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE CASE TABLE
---------------------------------------------------
``_SEMANTIC_MIN_COSINE`` and its ``>= :min_cosine`` predicate are reachable only
through :func:`postgres_semantic_search`, and the case table
(:mod:`tripl.tests.relevance.cases`) deliberately runs with the semantic leg
OFF — ``seeded_corpus`` hard-fails if embeddings are enabled, because a live
provider would make the lexical rankings irreproducible. The headline fix of
tripl-txcz was therefore asserted by nothing at all: the floor could be deleted,
or set to 0.0, and every test in the repository would still pass.

The way out is that the floor does not need a provider — it needs VECTORS. This
module stamps three hand-built unit vectors onto three corpus documents and
queries the real SQL with a fourth, so the predicate under test executes against
a real PostgreSQL with pgvector and arithmetic that is exact rather than
model-dependent. No embedding call, no API key, and the case table's "the
semantic leg does not run here" invariant is untouched: these rows are written
inside the test's own transaction and are never committed, so nothing else in
the harness ever sees an embedded document.
