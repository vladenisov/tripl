"""The stemming invariant, asserted on the mechanism itself (tripl-uojz).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS THE PRIMARY GUARD
-----------------------------------------------------
Three times now the relevance harness has certified a search change that was
wrong on production, and every one of those false greens had the same shape: the
claim was about RETRIEVAL — can this form of this word reach that form of that
word — and it was tested through RANKING, over a corpus, where a dozen unrelated
mechanisms (trigram similarity, the ``LIKE`` tiers, the boost ladder, term
frequency) can supply the right answer for the wrong reason.

* the ``ts_rank_cd`` normalization flag could be deleted with the whole table
  staying green, because no corpus document had the repetition profile that
  makes normalization observable;
* the ``улов``/``уловы`` pair asserted on ONE document that carried BOTH
  lexemes, so either query retrieved it by a different lexeme and the asymmetry
  between them was invisible;
* on the strength of that pair, a query-side-only repair for tripl-uojz was
  certified and was wrong on production.

So this file tests the mechanism directly. It has NO corpus, seeds NOTHING,
executes no ranking SQL and reads no score. It asks Postgres one question, over
and over: does a document consisting of exactly one word form get matched by a
query for exactly one other form of the same word? That question has no second
path to a yes. There is no title to be trigram-similar to, no body for a
``LIKE`` to find a substring in, no boost tier to fire. Either the tsvector and
the tsquery share a lexeme or they do not.

THE INVARIANT
-------------
Every token ``w`` contributes ``{stem(w), surface(w)}`` on BOTH sides — see
``search_service.TEXT_VECTOR_EXPRESSION`` (document) and
``_search_query.TEXT_QUERY_EXPRESSION`` (query). Two forms A and B therefore
meet iff those sets intersect. They already met when ``stem(A) == stem(B)``,
which is what a7c3e1b9d5f2 bought. What was missing, and what tripl-uojz adds,
is ``surface(A) == stem(B)``: Snowball over-stems the shortest form of a word
onto a lexeme that SOME of its inflections never produce (measured on
production: ``to_tsvector('tripl_search', 'уловы улов уловов')`` is
``'ул':2 'улов':1,3``), and the form that gets over-stripped is spelled the same
as the stem those inflections do land on.

How many of a word's forms fall on each side is a per-word fact and not a rule:
for ``улов`` only the bare nominative over-stems, while for ``экран`` the
nominative, the genitive AND the nominative plural all land on ``экра`` and only
``экране`` reaches ``экран``. See the measured table below before writing down a
pair.

THIS FILE IMPORTS THE SHIPPED EXPRESSIONS; IT DOES NOT COPY THEM
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Both constants are imported from the service modules and interpolated into the
SQL below verbatim. A copied literal would keep passing after either side was
edited — and "the two strings agree by convention" is exactly the arrangement
that let the index and the query drift apart in the first place. If someone
changes what a document indexes without changing what a query asks for, these
assertions are what goes red.

WHY THE WORD FORMS BELOW AND NOT OTHERS
----------------------------------------
Every form here is production vocabulary, taken from the read-only measurement
of the deployed database (image d47b55b2, alembic_version a7c3e1b9d5f2) that
this issue is built on: lemma / over-stem, with the number of production
``search_documents`` rows holding each::

    экран/экра   414/3971     показа/показ   341/429
    открыт/откр  302/260      закрыт/закр    183/100
    создан/созда 124/172      найден/найд     18/181
    выключен/выключ 10/137    архив/арх       23/53
    улов/ул      151/0

WHICH INDIVIDUAL FORMS WERE STEMMED, AND WHICH WERE ONLY REASONED ABOUT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The row counts above say which LEXEMES exist in production. They do not say
which FORM produces which lexeme, and assuming the obvious mapping is how the
first version of this file ended up asserting a vacuous pair. Every form
stemmed directly against the deployed database (tripl-uojz)::

    экран -> экра     улов  -> ул      архив  -> арх
    экрана -> экра    уловы -> улов    архивы -> архив
    экраны -> экра    улова -> улов
    экране -> экран

The ``улов``, ``экран`` and ``архив`` groups below contain those forms and no
others. The remaining groups (``показ``, ``открыт``, ``закрыт``, ``создан``,
``найден``, ``выключен``) were NOT stemmed form by form; they rest on the
base-vs-derived argument in the next paragraph. If one of them goes red, read it
as the measurement this file never had — that paradigm splits the way ``экран``
does — before reading it as a regression.

The forms in a group are ONE inflectional paradigm — a base form plus that base
form with an ending on it. That restriction is not tidiness, it is what makes
the assertion safe to make without a database in hand. For a base ``B`` and a
form ``B+suffix``, a stemmer either strips only the added suffix (landing on
``B``, which is ``surface(B)``) or strips the added suffix together with what it
would have stripped from ``B`` anyway (landing on ``stem(B)``). Either way the
sets intersect, so the invariant holds for every BASE-vs-DERIVED pair.

That argument does NOT extend to two derived forms, and adding a third form to a
group silently asserts the derived-vs-derived pairs as well. Read the next
section before widening any group here.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, AND WHY THAT IS A FINDING AND NOT A GAP
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Two INFLECTED forms of one word can still land in different classes, and then
neither the stem leg nor the identity leg joins them. Measured, not guessed
(tripl-uojz):

    экран -> экра    экрана -> экра    экраны -> экра    экране -> экран

``экрана`` indexes ``{экра, экрана}`` and ``экране`` asks ``{экран, экране}``;
those sets do not intersect, so that pair misses in both directions, and
``экраны``/``экране`` misses for the same reason. Those pairs are NOT listed
here, and the reason is stated rather than hidden: this fix
does not repair them, the implementation docstrings say so ("two forms that both
over-stem, to different lexemes, whose surfaces match neither stem, would still
miss"), and a test that quietly omitted them while claiming to assert "every
form reaches every other form" would be one more comfortable lie. What is
asserted is what the fix actually delivers. Widening it is its own issue, and it
needs a different mechanism (a query-time expansion, or a dictionary) than a
second configuration.
