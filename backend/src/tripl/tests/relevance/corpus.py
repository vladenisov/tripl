"""The miniature corpus the search-relevance harness ranks against (tripl-338u).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The backend suite runs on in-memory SQLite (``tests/conftest.py``), and search
keeps a hand-written Python fallback (``_search_query.sqlite_search``) for
exactly that reason. The consequence is that the PRODUCTION ranking SQL —
``postgres_lexical_search`` (``services/_search_query.py``), the semantic leg,
and ``merge_results`` — has never been executed by a test. Every weight in that
SQL is therefore unfalsifiable: you can change ``lexical_score * 4.0`` to
anything at all and the suite stays green. This corpus is the input half of the
fix; :mod:`tripl.tests.relevance.cases` is the expectation half.

WHAT IT REPRODUCES
------------------
It is a deliberate miniature of three ranking faults measured on production
(26 queries, three real projects, every response HTTP 200):

* **Harvested-value noise beats the real entity.** One production project holds
  1526 auto-detected "variables" that are really harvested field values. A
  variable document used to repeat the variable name, the bound event names and
  every observed value in BOTH ``body`` and ``keywords``
  (``_search_documents._variable_document``), and ``ts_rank_cd`` was called with
  no normalization flag and weighted x4, so raw term frequency scaled without
  bound. Both halves were fixed by tripl-gbxj — harvested values are body text
  only, and the rank is normalized with flag 32 — and the two cases below that
  measured it no longer carry an ``xfail``. Measured before that: ``q='spot'`` returned
  ``${property.spot_id}`` at 73.69 and ``${property.cube}`` at 55.68 — the
  latter purely because one harvested value is ``spot:reload:bento`` — while the
  events actually named ``spot`` and ``screen_spot`` did not appear at all.
  Reproduced here by ``property.spot_id`` / ``property.cube`` /
  ``page_data.extra.spot_id``, whose bound contexts outnumber any single event's.
  Those three reproduce the SHAPE of the fault but not its SCALE, and only the
  scale separates the two code paths: normalization flag 32 bends outliers and
  leaves ordinary scores alone, so at the handful of values per context those
  three carry, the fixed and the unnormalized SQL order this corpus
  identically. ``property.card_target`` — 180
  repetitions of one token in a single document, the production profile — is what
  makes the normalization half falsifiable; read its comment for the arithmetic.

* **No stemming in any language.** ``tripl_search`` was
  ``CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION ... (COPY = simple)`` with only ``unaccent``
  mapped, and ``simple`` does not stem. Measured: ``q='улов'`` 3.006 with the
  catch-report events on top vs ``q='уловы'`` 0.900 with every catch-report event
  gone; ``q='purchase'`` 19.565 vs ``q='purchases'`` 5.160; ``q='spots'`` never
  returns ``spot``. Reproduced by ``catch_report_created`` / ``purchase_completed``
  carrying only the singular, and by ``property.screen_name`` — a harvested screen
  name whose observed values happen to include the plurals ``purchases``,
  ``уловы`` and ``spots``, which is what a plural query hit instead. Fixed by
  tripl-nh5s (migration ``a7c3e1b9d5f2``), and the corpus is deliberately built so
  that the fix cannot be faked: the singular entity and the plural-spelling
  variable are BOTH in the index, so a plural query has a wrong answer available
  to it and has to out-rank it rather than merely retrieve something.

* **The stemmer splits a word into two unreachable halves** (tripl-uojz).
  a7c3e1b9d5f2 fixed the bullet above and introduced this one: Snowball
  over-stems the bare nominative onto a lexeme none of that word's own
  inflections produce (``улов`` -> ``ул``, ``экран`` -> ``экра``), so the word
  becomes two disjoint lexical classes. Measured on the deployed database, the
  over-stem class is the MAJORITY for the commonest vocabulary — ``экра`` 3971
  rows against ``экран`` 414 — which is what makes the breakage bidirectional.
  Reproduced by ``property.screen_kind``, the one document here that holds a bare
  nominative and NO inflected form of the same word; ``catch_report_created`` was
  simultaneously stripped of the bare nominative it should never have had, so it
  now holds the lemma class and nothing else. Read both of their comments before
  editing either: this corpus previously put both classes into every Russian
  document, which is why it certified a repair that was wrong on production.

* **The boost ladder cannot see a phrase or Cyrillic.**
  ``token_boundary_regex`` returns ``None`` for anything outside ``[a-z0-9_]+``,
  which removes the 3.5/3.0 tiers for every query with a space or Cyrillic, and
  the surviving ``LIKE`` tiers compare a spaced query against an underscored
  title. Measured: ``q='screen spot'`` ranked ``screen_spot`` 5th at 4.545;
  ``q='экран спота'`` never returned it, though its description is literally
  ``Показ экрана спота``. Reproduced by that exact event plus same-type siblings
  (``screen_home``, ``screen_settings``, ``app_open``) that share its subtitle, so
  a hit surviving on subtitle trigram similarity alone cannot land on top by luck.

* **Confidence is normalized to the top hit**, so a query that matched nothing is
  still served at confidence 1.0 (measured: ``q='asdkjhasd'`` at 1.0 on an
  absolute score of 0.636). Reproduced by ``property.session_key``, whose
  harvested values are junk device keys — one of them contains ``asdkjhasd``, so
  a garbage query retrieves something weak instead of retrieving nothing, which
  is what makes the confidence claim observable at all.

TWO DELIBERATE OMISSIONS
------------------------
The ``pageviews`` field definitions are named ``view_id`` / ``card_id`` rather
than ``screen`` / ``spot_id``. Field names are copied into the event-type
document (``_event_type_document`` folds ``field_text`` into ``body``), and any
event-type document that matches the query multiplies EVERY event of that type by
up to 1.75 (``_search_query._apply_event_type_boost``). Naming the fields after
the query terms would silently apply that multiplier to the very events under
measurement and turn each case into a test of the type boost instead of a test of
the lexical ranking. The events, their values and the variables still carry
``screen``/``spot`` exactly as production does.

No event tags are seeded. A tag document has ``keywords = tag.name``, which trips
the ``lower(d.keywords) = lower(:query)`` 4.0 tier and would add a fourth,
unrelated competitor to every single-word case for no extra signal.

The corpus is ~30 documents: small enough to read end to end, large enough that
no case is decided by having only one candidate.

    # Fault B, Russian half — and the seed that CERTIFIED A BROKEN FIX (tripl-uojz).
    #
    # WHAT THIS SEED USED TO BE, AND WHY IT WAS A LIE
    # It carried the bare nominative "улов" twice in the description and once
    # more as the `catch_kind` VALUE, which `_search_documents._event_document`
    # folds into both `body` (via safe_values) and `keywords`. Production
    # contains ZERO documents holding that lexeme: measured улов/ул = 151/0, i.e.
    # 151 rows hold the lemma every INFLECTED form produces and not one row holds
    # the over-stem "ул" the bare nominative produces. The surface form seeded
    # here was one the product does not emit.
    #
    # Worse, this ONE document was what BOTH ulov cases asserted on, and it
    # carried BOTH lexemes at once: "ул" from the bare nominative, and "улов"
    # from the stem of "Отчёт об улове" / "Тип улова" / "Вес улова". Either query
    # retrieved it, by a DIFFERENT lexeme each time, so the asymmetry between
    # them was invisible. A query-side-only repair for tripl-uojz passed this
    # table and was wrong on production — the harness's third false green.
    #
    # WHAT IT IS NOW
    # Only INFLECTED forms: "улове" and "улова" in the description, and a
    # `catch_kind` value that is an actual catch kind ("щука") rather than the
    # word "улов" repeated back. Nothing in this document's title, subtitle, body
    # or keywords tokenizes to the bare nominative any more, so the document
    # holds the lemma class and NOT the over-stem class — which is the shape all
    # 151 production rows have.
    #
    # WHAT THAT BUYS, AND WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT BUY — READ BEFORE TRUSTING IT
    # It buys honesty: `q='улов'` now has to cross from the over-stem class into
    # the lemma class to reach this document, which is the production fault. It
    # does NOT buy a discriminating RETRIEVAL case, and pretending otherwise
    # would repeat the mistake this comment is about. Every Russian nominative is
    # a PREFIX of its own inflections, so `lower(concat_ws(...)) LIKE '%улов%'`
    # in `postgres_lexical_search`'s WHERE matches "улове" and retrieves this
    # document even with the stemmer misbehaving and the surface leg absent. The
    # boost drops from the 3.25 stemmed tier to the 2.25 body-LIKE tier, so the
    # fault is visible in the ORDER, not in the retrieval set — and an ordering
    # margin is exactly the kind of evidence this harness has already been wrong
    # about twice.
    #
    # The direction that IS pinned through retrieval, immune to LIKE and to
    # trigram, is the mirror one: a document holding ONLY a bare nominative,
    # queried by an inflected form the document does not contain as a substring.
    # That lives on `property.screen_kind` below, on `экран` — the word whose
    # over-stem class is the production MAJORITY (3971 rows vs 414) — because
    # `улов` has no production document in that class to imitate. The mechanism
    # itself, in both directions and with no corpus at all, is asserted by
    # `test_stemming_invariants.py`, which is where the real guard lives.

#: the corpus after tripl-nh5s because they are the wrong answer the fix has to
#: OUT-RANK: each of them still spells the plural literally, which is worth a 3.0
#: body-token boost that no correctly-spelled entity can earn — the reason a
#: stemmer alone did not move these queries and the ladder needed the 3.25 tier.
_SCREEN_NAMES: tuple[str, ...] = ("purchases", "уловы", "spots", "экран_поиска")

#: Harvested surface kinds. THE OVER-STEM DOCUMENT (tripl-uojz).
#:
#: WHY A DOCUMENT THAT HOLDS ONLY A BARE NOMINATIVE HAD TO BE ADDED
#: Snowball splits a word into two disjoint lexical classes: the bare nominative
#: over-stems onto a lexeme that SOME of its inflections never reach (`экран` ->
#: `экра`) while those inflections land on the lemma (`экране` -> `экран`).
#:
#: Which inflections, exactly, is the thing to look up rather than guess, and
#: guessing it is what produced a case that passed with the fix reverted
#: (tripl-uojz). Measured: `экран`, `экрана` and `экраны` ALL stem to `экра`;
#: only `экране` stems to `экран`. So the query that reaches this document ONLY
#: through the surface leg is `q='экране'` — `q='экрана'` reaches it on the stem
#: leg like any other word.
#:
#: Before this variable existed, EVERY Russian document in this corpus carried both
#: classes at once — `catch_report_created` held the nominative "улов" beside the
#: inflected "улове"/"улова", the `Экран` field holds its own display name beside
#: "Идентификатор показанного экрана", and each pageview event holds
#: "экран_поиска" beside "Показ экрана ...". A document that holds both classes
#: is reachable by either query through whichever lexeme happens to match, so the
#: split is invisible and a repair for it cannot be falsified. That is not a gap
#: in coverage, it is a corpus that reports success either way.
#:
#: WHY `экран` AND NOT `улов`
#: `улов` has no production document in the over-stem class at all (улов/ул =
#: 151/0), so seeding one would be inventing traffic. `экран` is the opposite
#: case and the strongest one measured: 3971 production rows hold the over-stem
#: `экра` against 414 holding the lemma `экран`. A document in that class is the
#: MAJORITY shape, and it is what killed the query-side-only repair.
#:
#: WHY THIS DOCUMENT IS CLEAN, CHECKED AGAINST `_search_documents`
#: `_variable_document` builds body from the variable name, its source name, its
#: description and `_variable_context_text`, and keywords from the same minus the
#: harvested VALUES (tripl-gbxj). So the only Cyrillic that can reach this
#: document's indexed text is: the description, the bound field's `display_name`,
#: and these values. The description below carries no form of `экран`; the bound
#: field is `card_id` / "Карточка"; and of the values only "экран" is a form of
#: it, in the bare nominative. The document therefore holds `экра` and the
#: surface `экран`, and no lexeme from the lemma class.
#:
#: WHY THE RESULTING CASE CANNOT PASS FOR THE WRONG REASON
#: `q='экране'` reaches it ONLY through the surface leg, because every other path
#: in `postgres_lexical_search`'s WHERE is closed by construction: the values are
#: body-only so `keywords % :query` sees no Cyrillic at all, `title` is
#: `${property.screen_kind}` and `subtitle` is `string` so neither is
#: trigram-similar to a Russian word, and `LIKE '%экране%'` cannot match a
#: document whose longest spelling is the five letters "экран". Delete the surface
#: leg from either side and the document is not retrieved at all — a retrieval
#: failure, not an ordering one, which is the only kind of evidence this harness
#: has not already been wrong about.
#:
#: WHY THESE BINDINGS, WHICH LOOK ARBITRARY
#: Same reason `property.card_target` uses them, and the same warning applies:
#: `_event_document` folds a variable's values into an EVENT's body and keywords,
#: but only for fields that event has a recorded value for. `app_open` and
#: `screen_home` declare a `view_id` value and no `card_id` value, so binding
#: here reaches exactly one document — this variable's — and no event document
#: acquires a bare `экран`. Binding to `view_id` instead would put the nominative
#: into three event documents that already hold the lemma class, which would undo
#: the isolation this seed exists to create.
_SCREEN_KINDS: tuple[str, ...] = ("экран", "модалка", "шторка", "оверлей")

#: Harvested town names — the shape of the 1526 auto-detected "variables" that are
#: really field values. They match none of the queries; they are here so the
#: corpus has the same kind of bulk the production index has.
_TOWNS: tuple[str, ...] = ("Тверь", "Казань", "Сочи", "Пермь", "Уфа", "Тула", "Омск", "Клин")

#: Harvested session keys. `asdkjhasd7f2` is what makes the confidence case
#: observable: a garbage query retrieves this weakly instead of retrieving
#: nothing, and today it is still served at confidence 1.0.
_SESSION_KEYS: tuple[str, ...] = ("asdkjhasd7f2", "k18sjdhq", "a91mzz01")

#: Harvested card destinations: the identifier of the screen a settings card
#: opens. THE REPETITION OUTLIER (tripl-gbxj, normalization half).
#:
#: WHY THIS EXISTS NEXT TO THE SPOT VARIABLES ABOVE, WHICH LOOK LIKE THE SAME THING
#: `property.spot_id` and friends reproduce the SHAPE of fault A — a
#: harvested-value document mentioning the query term more often than the entity
#: named after it — but not its SCALE, and scale is the only thing the
#: normalization flag reacts to. Flag 32 is `rank / (rank + 1)`: it bends
#: OUTLIERS and leaves ordinary scores essentially untouched, so at the four-to-
#: eight values per context every variable above carries, the two code paths —
#: `ts_rank_cd(d.text_vector, q.tsq, 32)` and the
#: unnormalized `ts_rank_cd(d.text_vector, q.tsq)` it replaced — order this corpus
#: identically. Measured before this variable existed: reverting the flag left the
#: harness byte-identically green (14 passed, 1 xfailed), so half of tripl-gbxj
#: had no regression guard at all while the other half — harvested values out of
#: `keywords` — was pinned by `purchase-plural`. This variable is the missing
#: input; `cases.repetition-outlier-does-not-outrank-the-screen-it-names` is the
#: missing expectation.
#:
#: WHY 180 OCCURRENCES AND NOT SOME OTHER NUMBER
#: The production fault needed scale: 1526 auto-detected harvested-value
#: variables, one document repeating the query token roughly 180 times, which
#: drove its raw `ts_rank_cd` to ~18 and its lexical leg (`* 4.0`) to ~68 — an
#: order of magnitude past the entire boost ladder — against a correct answer at
#: 4.55 (see `_search_query.postgres_lexical_search`). So the count here is that
#: count: 6 sections x 15 card ids = 90 values, bound to 2 contexts = 180
#: occurrences of the `screen`+`settings` cover in one body. Measured on the real
#: `tripl_search` configuration, both halves of the arithmetic hold:
#:
#: * unnormalized, raw rank 18.0 -> lexical leg 72.0, and this document scores
#:   ~74.5 against the `screen_settings` EVENT's 9.0 (5.0 exact title + 2.0
#:   trigram + 2.0 lexical). The revert loses by 65 points, not by a rounding
#:   error;
#: * normalized, the same rank collapses to 0.947 -> lexical leg 3.79, and the
#:   document scores ~6.24 against the event's 8.33. The case passes with ~2
#:   points of margin, which is wider than any single tier of the boost ladder.
#:
#: 180 is also comfortably under the 256 positions a `tsvector` keeps per lexeme,
#: so the outlier is carried by the rank rather than silently truncated by the
#: index — a larger count would not have made the failure any louder.
#:
#: WHY THE VALUES ARE UNDERSCORE-JOINED
#: PostgreSQL's `\m...\M` word boundaries treat `_` as a word character, so
#: `screen_settings_billing_1040` never fires the 3.5 (keywords) or 3.0 (body)
#: token tiers, and this document's only boost is the 2.25 body-LIKE tier. The
#: text-search parser splits on `_` regardless, so `ts_rank_cd` still sees all 180
#: covers. What lifts this document under the reverted code is therefore
#: `ts_rank_cd` and nothing else — which is exactly the mutation the case pins.

    # The repetition outlier (tripl-gbxj). See _SETTINGS_CARD_TARGETS for why the
    # count is 180 and what each code path scores.
    #
    # THE BINDINGS ARE WHAT KEEP THE BLAST RADIUS AT ZERO — DO NOT "TIDY" THEM
    # Both contexts bind to `card_id` on events that declare no card_id value of
    # their own: EVENTS gives `app_open` and `screen_home` a `view_id` value and
    # nothing else. That is deliberate. `_search_documents._event_document` folds a
    # variable's harvested values into an event's body AND its keywords, but it
    # iterates the event's own `field_values` and only picks up contexts for
    # fields the event actually has a recorded value for — so with these bindings
    # the 180 repetitions reach exactly ONE document, this variable's.
    #
    # Binding to `view_id` instead (the obvious-looking choice, since that is
    # where every other pageview variable binds) would copy 180 `screen_settings`
    # occurrences into the `app_open` and `screen_home` event documents and hand
    # both of them a saturated lexical leg plus the 3.25 stemmed tier. `app_open`
    # already carries `spot` lexemes from `property.spot_id`, so it would newly
    # match `q='screen spot'` at ~7.0 and start competing with the `screen_spot`
    # event the `spaced-query-finds-underscored-event` case expects on top — a
    # green case re-baselined by a test-only addition, which is exactly what this
    # change is required not to do. Binding to `screen_settings` itself is wrong
    # for the mirror-image reason: the event name would enter this document's
    # keywords and buy it the 3.5 token tier, closing the margin the case needs.
    #
    # A harvested variable with no matching EventFieldValue is the production
    # shape, not a workaround: variables are auto-detected from ingested traffic
    # (hence `observed_count` in the thousands), while an event's field value is
    # the example its spec carries. The two are populated by different pipelines
    # and routinely disagree.

    # THE DESCRIPTION IS LOAD-BEARING AND MUST STAY FREE OF EVERY FORM OF `экран`.
    # The document may hold `экра` (from the bare `экран` value) and nothing else
    # of this word. Any wording carrying a form that stems to `экран` — "на
    # экране", "Тип экрана на экране" — hands the document the lemma lexeme and
    # `q='экране'` then reaches it on the stem leg alone, so the case passes with
    # the fix reverted. That is the exact failure this seed was added to end, and
    # it is not the failure the obvious guess protects against: `экрана` stems to
    # `экра`, the same class the document already holds, so wording built around
    # THAT form would be harmless here and is not what to look for (tripl-uojz).
