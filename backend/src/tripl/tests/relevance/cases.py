"""The relevance case table: query -> what must rank first, what must not beat it.

WHY A TABLE AND NOT PROSE ASSERTIONS
------------------------------------
Every entry here was measured against production before it was written down
(tripl-338u): 26 queries over three real projects, every response HTTP 200. Ten
cases, each of them "this query must produce exactly this ranking, and here is
what actually beat it in production".

TWO cases are NOT among those ten, and each says so in its own ``measured``
field rather than borrowing the credibility of the others:

* ``repetition-outlier-does-not-outrank-the-screen-it-names``. A measured
  production query could not reach the fault — the corpus had no document with
  the repetition profile the production fault needed, so the ``ts_rank_cd``
  normalization it pins was invisible to every other case. Its input
  (``corpus._SETTINGS_CARD_TARGETS``) is built to the measured production
  profile even though the query that reads it is constructed here.
* ``over-stemmed-nominative-is-reachable-from-an-inflected-query``
  (tripl-uojz). Same shape, different mechanism: no production query could
  distinguish the over-stem fault while every Russian document in the corpus
  held both lexical classes at once. Its input
  (``corpus._SCREEN_KINDS``) is built to the measured production shape — the
  3971 rows stranded on ``экра`` — and the query is constructed here.

RETRIEVAL AND ORDERING ARE SEPARATE TESTS, AND ONLY ORDERING MAY BE ``xfail``ED
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A case makes up to three claims, and they are not equally strong. "The right
document comes back at all" is retrieval; "it comes back FIRST, ahead of these
named competitors" is ordering; "this is not served as a certain answer" is
confidence. ``test_search_relevance`` asserts them in three separate test
functions on purpose (tripl-uojz).

The reason is a hole this table used to have. ``pytest.mark.xfail`` marks a
FUNCTION, so while one function asserted retrieval and ordering together, an
``xfail`` filed against a RANKING nuance also excused the document vanishing from
the results entirely. ``russian-phrase-finds-the-event-it-describes`` is the live
example: it is xfailed because a short almost-exact title outranks a complete
match, and under the old arrangement ``screen_spot`` could have stopped being
retrieved at all — the fault four fixes were aimed at — with the case still
reporting a tidy expected failure. The field is therefore named
``xfail_ordering``, it is read by the ordering test and by nothing else, and
there is no way to express "this case is allowed not to find the document".

``must_retrieve`` is the other half: documents that must appear SOMEWHERE in the
results, with no claim about where. It is for facts about the retrieval
mechanism that have no measured ranking, and for competitors whose PRESENCE is
what a case depends on — ``must_not_outrank`` is satisfied when a competitor is
absent, so a regression that stopped retrieving the wrong answer would otherwise
turn the plural cases green by deleting the thing they out-rank.

WHAT THE ``xfail_ordering`` FIELD IS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE HERE
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A case whose ORDER today's ranking gets wrong is marked ``xfail(strict=True)`` —
an unexpected PASS is a hard failure, so a fix cannot land unnoticed with a stale
marker — and the commit DELETING an ``xfail_ordering`` is the proof that fix
worked.

For the FOUR fixed faults that proof does not exist in this repository's history,
and this docstring will not pretend otherwise: the harness and those four fixes
landed in ONE commit, so no case ever carried a marker on a merged branch. What
the table proves for them is weaker and worth saying plainly — it proves the
ranking is right NOW, and it will catch the next regression in it. Their real
proof was by MUTATION, named on each case: revert the source change, watch that
case go red.

The mechanism itself is live, on exactly one case.
``russian-phrase-finds-the-event-it-describes`` carries an ``xfail_ordering`` for
tripl-9t2s — a fault the four fixes did not address, filed rather than tuned
away. Deleting that marker is the proof for that issue, in the workflow this
field exists for. Its RETRIEVAL claim is asserted unconditionally alongside it,
which is new and is the point of the split above.

The rule that is NOT negotiable either way: an assertion is never weakened to
make a case pass.

WHAT EACH CASE CAN AND CANNOT PIN — THE AUDIT, WRITTEN DOWN (tripl-uojz)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
"The harness passes" has now been insufficient evidence three times, so every
case below has been asked the only question that matters about it: could it be
green with the fix it names reverted? The answers are on the cases themselves.
Two are worth pulling up here because they contradict what this docstring used
to claim:

* **The two ``spot`` cases pin NEITHER half of tripl-gbxj on its own.** Deleting
  normalization flag 32 was MEASURED to leave the whole table green — that is
  why ``repetition-outlier-does-not-outrank-the-screen-it-names`` had to be
  built. And the keywords half is pinned by ``purchase-plural``, which is the
  case this docstring cited as evidence for the ``spot`` cases; a citation to a
  different case is not evidence about these. What they pin is the two mutations
  TOGETHER, and what they are genuinely good for is being a regression guard on
  a ranking that is correct today.
* **Neither ``улов`` case pins tripl-uojz, and no ordering case can.** See
  ``ulov-singular``. The mechanism is asserted by
  :mod:`tripl.tests.relevance.test_stemming_invariants`, which uses no corpus at
  all; the one corpus case that pins it through RETRIEVAL is
  ``over-stemmed-nominative-is-reachable-from-an-inflected-query``.

WHAT HAS BEEN FIXED
-------------------
Four faults were measured. All four are fixed, and every case below passes
except the one that carries an ``xfail`` (see ``russian-phrase-...``):

* **tripl-gbxj** (unbounded ``ts_rank_cd`` x4.0, harvested values joined into
  variable keywords) — ``spot`` and ``screen_spot`` now rank their own event
  first instead of the variables that merely mention it. Those two cases pin
  neither half ON ITS OWN, and this used to say otherwise. Deleting
  normalization flag 32 was measured to leave the whole table green, because
  ``rank / (rank + 1)`` only bends outliers and this corpus had none —
  ``repetition-outlier-does-not-outrank-the-screen-it-names`` is the case built
  to close that gap. The keywords half is pinned by ``purchase-plural``:
  restoring ``include_values=True`` in ``_search_documents._variable_document``
  fails THAT case, and nothing measured says it fails these two.
* **tripl-h9x2** (``token_boundary_regex`` refused every query with a space, and
  the surviving tiers compared a spaced query against an underscored title) —
  ``screen spot`` now finds ``screen_spot``.
* **tripl-txcz** (confidence normalized to the top hit) — a keyboard-mash query
  is no longer served as a certain answer.
* **tripl-nh5s** (``tripl_search`` was ``COPY = simple``, which stems in no
  language) — migration ``a7c3e1b9d5f2`` routes ASCII word tokens to an English
  Snowball dictionary and non-ASCII word tokens to a Russian one, so a plural
  reaches its singular and ``экрана спота`` reaches ``экран``. The same issue
  added the 3.25 tier to the boost ladder, without which the stemmer fixed
  RETRIEVAL and left the RANKING where it was: every other tier compares literal
  characters, so a plural query could still only reach the ladder through the
  harvested value that happens to spell the plural.
* **tripl-0qld** (``_event_document`` joined harvested values into an EVENT's
  ``keywords``, so the tier above it rested on a false premise) — the fix
  tripl-gbxj made to ``_variable_document`` was never made to the event builder,
  and ``keywords`` is the column BOTH the 3.5 literal-token tier and the 3.25
  stemmed tier read. ``${property.screen_name}`` is bound to the ``view_id``
  field of ``app_open``, ``screen_home`` and ``screen_settings``, so its
  harvested plurals sat in those three events' keywords and paid them 3.5 for
  ``q='purchases'``, ``q='spots'`` and ``q='уловы'`` — above the 3.25 the
  correctly-named entity earns, and none of the three was named in any
  ``must_not_outrank``. All three plural cases below were green anyway, on the
  trigram leg; that is the point of the entry. The ladder now orders them, the
  three carriers take the 3.0 body tier, and the claim is asserted on the boost
  column itself by :mod:`tripl.tests.relevance.test_keyword_tier_premise` rather
  than inferred from a total score.

Two cases (``purchase``, ``улов``) are load-bearing in the opposite direction:
they are the singular halves of the stemming pairs and they already passed on
production before any of this. If a "fix" ever breaks them, the harness has
caught a regression rather than a missing feature — and they are also what proves
the harness discriminates instead of failing everything it is shown. That role
extends to every pair here: singular and plural are asserted side by side, so a
stemmer that over-merges (or a configuration change that quietly reverts to
``simple``) shows up as one half of a pair going red.

WHAT THIS TABLE DOES NOT COVER
------------------------------
Every case here runs with the semantic leg OFF (see
:mod:`tripl.tests.relevance.conftest` — the fixture hard-fails if embeddings are
enabled, because a live provider makes rankings irreproducible). The semantic
leg's own guarantees — the cosine floor and the confidence it reports — are
covered by :mod:`tripl.tests.relevance.test_semantic_floor`, which builds its
vectors by hand and needs no provider.

    claims which are asserted by two different test functions: that the document

    (xfailable). Nothing in ``must_not_outrank`` may be ranked above it — those
    are the documents that actually beat it on production, so they are named
    rather than implied, and a failure says which competitor won instead of just
    "wrong order".

    that is not returned at all, so a plural case would go green if the wrong

        # ~ 0.38 -> +0.76) covered the 0.25 the ladder had given away. A green

        # exactly the inversion tripl-uojz is about.
        #
        # THE SEED IT ASSERTS ON WAS ANTI-REPRESENTATIVE AND HAS BEEN FIXED
        # `catch_report_created` used to carry the bare nominative twice in its
        # description and once as its `catch_kind` value, ALONGSIDE the inflected
        # forms in `Отчёт об улове` / `Тип улова`. So the one document both ulov
        # cases assert on held BOTH lexical classes, each query retrieved it by a
