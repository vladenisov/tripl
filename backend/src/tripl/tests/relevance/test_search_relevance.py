"""The search-relevance harness: three tests per measured ranking case (tripl-338u).

ONE CASE, THREE CLAIMS, THREE TEST FUNCTIONS (tripl-uojz)
---------------------------------------------------------
A case asserts up to three different things and they do not deserve the same
treatment, so they are asserted separately:

* :func:`test_relevance_case_retrieves_what_it_names` — the document comes back
  at all. Never xfailable.
* :func:`test_relevance_case_ranks_the_expected_document_first` — it comes back
  first, ahead of the competitors that beat it on production. This is the ONLY
  one an ``xfail_ordering`` marker can excuse.
* :func:`test_relevance_case_does_not_overstate_confidence` — the top hit is not
  served as certain. Never xfailable.

They were one function, and ``pytest.mark.xfail`` marks a function, so a marker
filed against a ranking nuance also excused the document vanishing from the
results entirely. That was not hypothetical: ``russian-phrase-finds-the-event-it-
describes`` was xfailed for a scoring gap (tripl-9t2s) while the fault four
earlier fixes were aimed at is precisely ``screen_spot`` not being RETRIEVED —
so the harness was carrying a ranking marker that would have hidden the
regression it exists to catch. That marker is gone: tripl-9t2s shipped
``_search_query.COVERAGE_BONUS`` and the case passes on its own, which is what
:func:`test_the_coverage_term_is_what_wins_the_russian_phrase_case` below exists
to keep honest. The split outlives it — no case carries ``xfail_ordering``
today, and the next one that does will be excused for its ORDER only.

This is the first test in the repository that executes the production ranking
SQL. Everything else about search is asserted either against generated SQL
strings or against ``sqlite_search``, the Python fallback that exists only
because the suite runs on SQLite — so ``postgres_lexical_search``'s
``ts_rank_cd``/trigram/boost arithmetic and ``merge_results`` had no coverage at
all, and any weight in them could be changed without a single test noticing.

Read :mod:`tripl.tests.relevance.cases` for the case table and what each case was
measured to do on production, and :mod:`tripl.tests.relevance.corpus` for the
fixed corpus every case is ranked against.

WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT THE RIGHT TOOL FOR
----------------------------------------
Everything here is ranking over a corpus, and a corpus supplies many paths to
the right answer — trigram similarity, the ``LIKE`` tiers, term frequency. That
makes it strong evidence about ORDER and weak evidence about whether a
RETRIEVAL mechanism works, because the mechanism under test is rarely the only
thing that could have produced the result. Claims about the text-search
mechanism itself belong in
:mod:`tripl.tests.relevance.test_stemming_invariants`, which seeds nothing and
asks Postgres a question with exactly one possible cause.
