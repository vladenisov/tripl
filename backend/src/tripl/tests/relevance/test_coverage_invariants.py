"""The coverage invariant, asserted on the mechanism itself (tripl-9t2s).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS THE PRIMARY GUARD FOR THE COVERAGE TERM
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
``COVERAGE_BONUS`` pays a document for satisfying ``d.text_vector @@ q.tsq``, and
that is only a COVERAGE signal because of a fact about the shipped tsquery:
``websearch_to_tsquery`` ANDs the terms WITHIN each leg, so
``_search_query.TEXT_QUERY_EXPRESSION`` is ``(a1 & b1) | (a2 & b2)`` and ``@@``
means "this document answered EVERY term", not "this document answered one of
them". If that ever became a disjunction, the bonus would silently turn into a
flat payment to every document that matched anything — the ranking would still
be green on the corpus for a while, and the term would have stopped measuring
what its name says.

So this file asks Postgres that one question directly, the way
:mod:`tripl.tests.relevance.test_stemming_invariants` does: NO corpus, nothing
seeded, no ranking SQL, no score. A document consisting of exactly one of the
query's two words either satisfies the shipped tsquery or it does not, and there
is no second path to a yes — no title to be trigram-similar to, no body for a
``LIKE`` to find a substring in, no boost tier to fire.

TWO ASSERTIONS, AND THE SECOND IS WHAT MAKES THE FIRST MEAN ANYTHING
---------------------------------------------------------------------
"``экране`` is not matched by ``q='экран спота'``" is satisfied by a great many
broken states: a stemmer that does nothing, a query expression that parses to
nothing, a configuration that vanished. So the same one-word document is also
asserted to BE matched by the part of the query it does hold (``q='экран'``), and
the two-word document to be matched by the whole query. The miss above is then
attributable to the CONJUNCTION and to nothing else.

WHY THESE WORD FORMS
--------------------
The Cyrillic pair is the measured fault: ``q='экран спота'`` is the harness case,
``Экран`` is the FIELD document whose entire title is one of the two words, and
``экране`` is the form ``test_stemming_invariants`` measured into the OTHER
lexical class from ``экран`` (``экран``/``экрана``/``экраны`` -> ``экра``,
``экране`` -> ``экран``). Using ``экране`` for the document therefore exercises
the stem-meets-surface identity at the same time, so a run where this file is
green only because the surface leg quietly matched everything would look
different from this one.

The English pair is a CONTROL, and it is not decoration: the two legs of the
tsquery are the Russian and the English Snowball dictionary routed by ASCII-ness
(migration ``a7c3e1b9d5f2``), so an assertion made only in Cyrillic says nothing
about the half of the corpus that is snake_case identifiers. ``screen`` and
``screen spot`` are the ASCII shape of exactly the same question.
