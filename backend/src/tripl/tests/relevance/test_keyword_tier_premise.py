"""The two keyword tiers, read on their own instead of through a total score (tripl-0qld).

WHY THE CASE TABLE COULD NOT SEE THIS
-------------------------------------
``test_search_relevance`` asserts ORDER, and an order is produced by three legs
added together — the boost ladder, ``ts_rank_cd * 4.0`` and the trigram
similarity ``* 2.0``. So a tier can be paying the WRONG document and the case can
still be green, as long as another leg covers the difference. That is not
hypothetical: until tripl-0qld, ``q='purchases'`` paid ``app_open``,
``screen_home`` and ``screen_settings`` the 3.5 literal keyword-token tier —
purely because ``${property.screen_name}`` had harvested the string ``purchases``
onto their ``view_id`` field and ``_event_document`` joined a variable's observed
values into an EVENT's ``keywords`` — while ``purchase_completed``, the entity the
query is about, reached only the 3.25 stemmed-identity tier. The ladder ordering
tripl-nh5s built ("a stemmed match on the entity's own name is stronger than the
literal token appearing somewhere in its body") was inverted for three unrelated
events, and ``cases.purchase-plural`` stayed green because the trigram leg
(``similarity('purchase_completed', 'purchases') ~ 0.38 -> +0.76``) more than
covered the 0.25 the ladder had given away.

This module therefore reads the ``boost`` column and nothing else. It imports
:data:`~tripl.services._search_query.BOOST_LADDER_EXPRESSION` and
:data:`~tripl.services._search_query.TEXT_QUERY_EXPRESSION` rather than copying
the SQL, for the same reason ``test_stemming_invariants`` imports its two
expressions: a copied literal keeps passing after the shipped one is edited,
which is precisely how this harness has certified a wrong repair before.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO, SAID HERE RATHER THAN IMPLIED
------------------------------------------------
It reproduces the ``ranked`` CTE's projection, not the whole query: no WHERE
retrieval clause, no ``ORDER BY``, no ``merge_results``. It is evidence about
which tier a document lands on and about nothing else. The claim "and therefore
the right document ranks first" is still ``test_search_relevance``'s to make.
