"""Batch 5, ClickHouse adapter: nested columns that are not JSON documents.

``tripl-0zpq.55`` — ClickHouse has three unrelated nested families (``JSON``,
``Map``, ``Tuple``) and one shape function per family. The adapter used to emit
``arraySort(JSONAllPaths(col))`` for every column the caller put in
``json_columns``, and the caller's split is
``warehouse_types.is_complex_type``, which counts all three as nested. So a
single ``Map`` or ``Tuple`` column anywhere in a source query made the warehouse
reject the statement outright — verified against ClickHouse 26.5.4.14::

    SELECT arraySort(JSONAllPaths(map('a','b')))
    Code: 43. Function JSONAllPaths requires argument with type JSON,
             got: Map(String, String). (ILLEGAL_TYPE_OF_ARGUMENT)

and the same for a Tuple. That killed every scan, every metrics collection and
JSON-key discovery for the whole scan config, with an opaque warehouse error.

These are fake-client SQL-string tests, and ``warehouse-parity.md`` is right that
a SQL string alone proves nothing about validity. What makes them worth writing
anyway is that each expression they pin was *executed* against a real
``clickhouse local`` 26.5.4.14 while the fix was written, including the whole
``GROUP BY ALL`` statement over a table carrying all three families at once. The
executable half belongs in ``tests/conformance/test_clickhouse_conformance.py``,
whose fixture has no Map or Tuple column today; widening that fixture is reported
as a follow-up rather than done here.

``tripl-0zpq.62`` — four docstrings in the same file each carried their own copy
of the return contract and three were wrong. Nothing here asserts prose; the
executable statement of those shapes is the conformance gate, which unpacks four
values from ``get_full_breakdown`` and three from ``get_time_bucketed_counts``.
