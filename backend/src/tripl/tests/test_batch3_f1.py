"""A group merge moves the survivor along the progression axis only (tripl-0zpq.84).

``event_status_rank`` deliberately orders ``deprecated`` (5) and ``archived``
(6) above ``live`` (4) so a closing implementation ticket cannot drag a retired
event back to ``implemented``. The group merge used to take a plain max over
that same table, which made "retire one member of a family" mean "retire the
whole group": the survivor came out ``deprecated``, with no sunset date and
nothing that ever lowers a status again.

These tests pin the rule the merge applies instead, in three parts: a retired
member does not retire the group, a live member does not revive a group the
user retired, and the surviving status is the SAME whichever member the walk
reaches first. That last one is not free. The pass walks its sources in
``scan_identity_winner_order()`` — most recently seen first — and the member it
reaches first is the one that mints the group row, so any status the mint copies
off that member is a status decided by warehouse traffic timing. The mint takes
a constant instead (``in_review``, where ``generate_events`` starts every
scan-minted event) and the fold is a max over the progression band, which is
commutative: retired members contribute nothing from any position, and every
other member contributes the same maximum in any order.
