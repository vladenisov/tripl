"""Plan revisions and relations: batch 7 of the backend review (tripl-0zpq).

* tripl-0zpq.149 — a key two rows share no longer swallows a change whole. The
  deletion of a namesake that is not the one listed last used to produce no
  diff entry at all, and two namesakes listed in a different order on the two
  sides used to read as an edit of one into the other.
* tripl-0zpq.154 — the revision list counts a snapshot's entities in the
  database instead of dragging every whole-plan payload into the event loop.
* tripl-0zpq.128 — a relation can only name event types and fields that live in
  the project branch it is created on, so no row is left that makes every later
  branch creation for the project raise KeyError.
