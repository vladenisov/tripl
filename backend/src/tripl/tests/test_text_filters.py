"""The NUL guard on free-text query filters (tripl-8wez).

``sanitize_query`` fixed ``/search`` (tripl-q4q7). The defect class is wider than
that route: any user string bound as a Postgres parameter aborts inside asyncpg
when it carries U+0000, and the events, metrics, metric-catalog, fact-table and
audit list filters all bind one. The fix is a route-parameter type, so this file
checks the type is actually *on* the parameters as well as that it works.
