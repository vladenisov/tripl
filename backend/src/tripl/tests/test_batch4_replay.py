"""Batch 4: what the rule REPLAY can see — ``tripl-0zpq.158``.

Live dispatch merges FIVE candidate sources (``worker/tasks/metrics/dispatch``);
the in-UI replay merged three. Variable-value drifts and release regressions
were never loaded, so they never reached ``tripl.alerting_matching`` at all and
a rule carrying ``include_variable_value_drifts`` or
``include_release_regressions`` replayed SILENT in every field at once —
``anomalies_considered``, ``matched_before_cooldown``, ``firings``, ``noisy``
and ``rendered_message`` are all derived from that one list. The operator read
"quiet, not noisy" for a rule that pages thirty times a week, and
``website/docs/use/troubleshooting.md``'s "if it doesn't match in the simulator
it won't match live either" was false for exactly those two scopes.

The fix is additive, and an additive fix is the easiest kind to prove with a
test that would also pass without it, so every test below names the line it
would catch. Five of them assert an ABSENCE — two drifts no live scan can reach
(one value drift, one schema drift), a variable taken out of scanning, a scan
with no version column, a rule with the toggle off — because loading too much is
the same defect as loading too little pointed the other way: a replay that is
louder than the pipeline is just as unusable as one that is quieter.

One family here was never about loading. ``project_total`` always reached the
replay and was never NAMED in it: ``_build_scope_name_map`` resolved every other
scope and had no branch for the one nearly every rule carries, so the preview
labelled those rows with a raw scan-config uuid where the delivered message says
"All events". Its two tests sit between the loading tests and the renderer ones
because the defect belongs to neither group.

The last three tests are not about loading at all. They are about what the two
newly reachable families SAY, and they render one release regression through
both production renderers and compare the whole item. That is where the
preview's hard-coded ``"expected_basis": ""`` shows up, and with it the LAST of
``window_from``'s three hops, ``alerting_rendering._drift_facts`` — those were
the last two places the preview and the send disagreed about a firing
(tripl-0zpq.165 closed the other two). They cannot show the first two hops:
they hand-build both objects, so that a firing the service ACTUALLY emits
carries the window is asserted over HTTP in
``test_a_release_regression_the_pipeline_delivers_now_reaches_the_replay``
instead.
