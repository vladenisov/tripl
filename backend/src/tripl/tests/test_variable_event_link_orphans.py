"""Why a Variable can end up with no Event linked to it.

The only thing that links a ``Variable`` to an ``Event`` is a ``VariableValue``
row keyed by ``(variable_id, event_id, field_definition_id)``. Scans are the only
writer on the happy path, and they rebuild those rows from the CURRENT scan
window while ``Variable`` rows live forever. These tests pin the two halves of
that asymmetry that a production audit of tripl.windyapp.co turned up:

* a rescan that rewrites a field value but KEEPS the ``${token}`` must re-record
  the context — dropping it there is what leaves a variable showing "0 events"
  while an event visibly still references it;
* a JSON column whose KEYS are free text mints one ``Variable`` per distinct
  key, and those variables outlive their contexts — generation never retires
  one, and the end-of-run sweep is what does (tripl-10h4).

    ``plan_column_meta`` needs a variable for EVERY distinct JSON path it sees,

    one ``Variable`` per distinct key. When a key stops appearing, the next scan
    rewrites the value without it and the context is correctly dropped; the

    ``worker.variable_sweep`` — but deliberately at the END of a scan run, once

    event type no longer references may still be the live property of another
    one, and a sweep running inside generation would judge it on a fraction of
    the evidence.

    So this pins the boundary rather than the defect: generation leaves the row,
