"""Batch 4: what an alert SAYS — one item, one weekly digest — and who gets it.

``tripl-0zpq.165`` — the rule simulator and the live send each built
``${scope_label}`` and ``${drift_line}`` from their own copy of the rules, and
the copies had drifted. One schema drift previewed as
``drift: type_changed: amount — e.g. 9.99`` and was then delivered as
``drift: type_changed amount sample=9.99``: an operator who tested a rule in the
simulator and then armed it got a different sentence about the same firing,
which is worse than having no simulator. Both strings now come from one builder
in ``tripl.alert_templates`` that both renderers call.

The wording kept is the SEND's, because that is the text an operator actually
receives and the text ``website/docs/use/alerting.md`` quotes. Only previews
moved; no delivered message and no stored payload snapshot changed.

Those two renderers are pure — no DB, no network, no Celery — so they are called
directly and compared string for string, because "the preview says what the send
says" is an equality and nothing weaker holds it.

``tripl-0zpq.34`` — the weekly plan digest counted its metric anomalies through
an inner join on ScanConfig, and a catalog metric has no scan config to join to:
``metric``-scope rows carry a NULL ``scan_config_id`` by design. A project whose
week produced only catalog-metric anomalies was told ``Metric anomalies: 0`` and
shown no Top anomalies section at all, while its Anomalies page listed every one
of them. That half needs rows, so it runs the real builder against a sqlite
session the way ``test_batch3_a2.py`` and ``test_alert_digest_delivery.py`` do.

``tripl-0zpq.33`` — and who that digest is sent to. Both tasks in
``worker/tasks/alerts_digest`` select every enabled Slack/email destination in
the database and send to it themselves, without minting an ``AlertDelivery`` and
without going through a send task, so the demo-project egress guard both send
tasks call was the one thing they never consulted: a demo
project holding an enabled external destination would have been posted to for
real, against a workspace the docs promise is zero-egress by construction. They
now exclude demo projects in the SELECT and call the guard at the one helper
both funnel through, and the tests below drive the real tasks over the same
sqlite fixture with the channel transport recorded instead of performed.
