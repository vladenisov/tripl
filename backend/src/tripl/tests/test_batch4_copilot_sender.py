"""Batch 4, review follow-up: the whitespace-only Default From.

``EmailSettingsUpdate._check_smtp_from_address`` guards the global Default From
with the send path's own helper, and its own comment says ``None`` and ``""``
are how the value is CLEARED. A whitespace-only string was neither: it skipped
the validator (``not value.strip()``) and was then returned unchanged, so a
``PATCH`` carrying ``smtp_from_address: "   "`` stored a TRUTHY blank — the one
state the comment said the field does not have.

Truthiness is the whole defect. Every reader of this setting asks whether it is
configured with ``not`` or ``or``, so a truthy blank passes for configured
everywhere and fails at the far end of each path with a diagnostic that names
something else: the alert reports an invalid From: address rather than an unset
one, Settings -> Send test email answers ``Not a usable From: address: '   '``
instead of the sentence it keeps for exactly this case, and password reset mints
a token, promises the mail, and hands SMTP a blank sender.

The fix folds whitespace into the empty string the clearing path already uses
rather than refusing it with a 422 — refusing would mean an operator who clears
the field by typing a space cannot reach a state the product supports, and the
value left behind would be the old sender, still sending.
