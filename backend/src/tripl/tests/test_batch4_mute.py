"""Batch-4: a muted monitor delivers nothing, on either delivery path.

``AlertRule.muted_until`` is read by the worker in two places —
``metrics.dispatch._prepare_alert_deliveries`` on the way in and
``alert_flush._build_digest`` when a scheduled digest is built — and only the
second of them was pinned by a test (``test_alert_digest_delivery.py``'s
"muting a monitor during the hold window"). The first one is the line
tripl-jfm3.99 added after the Mute button shipped writing a column no worker
read; deleting it today left the suite green, which is exactly how that bug
happened the first time. These cases hold the model comment on
``muted_until`` to the code it describes.

The seeding is imported from ``test_alert_digest_delivery`` rather than copied:
a second copy of the project/scan/destination/rule fixture stops matching the
first the moment any of those models gains a column.
