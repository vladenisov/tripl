"""Batch 7, lane B: fields and their audit trail.

Both findings routed to this lane have their DEFECT outside the lane's file
list, in another service each — ``schema_drift_service`` for tripl-0zpq.222 and
``demo/builders/audit`` for tripl-0zpq.246. A test does not have to live beside
the code it pins, so the two REGRESSION tests below drive those two fixes
through the API and name the exact edit that reddens them:

* tripl-0zpq.222 — ``schema_drift_service.apply_drift_action`` guarded its
  event-type cache bust on ``event_type.branch_id is None``, a NOT NULL column
  since the branches migration, so accepting a drift never busted the 300 s
  ``GET /event-types`` cache although it had just added, retyped or deleted a
  FieldDefinition. The fix reads the row's own branch the way
  ``field_service._on_main`` does. Both arms are pinned in one test, because
  one arm alone is not the spec: an unconditional bust satisfies the main arm,
  and the guard as written satisfies the branch arm.

* tripl-0zpq.246 — the demo audit builder claimed "one entry per authored
  object" while the relation, the event-type owner grant and the variable
  override had nothing in the trail, and filed the rows it did write in shapes
  the real routes have never used. ``test_batch7_seam.py`` pins that those
  action strings now EXIST; what is pinned here is their SHAPE, which nothing
  else looks at.

The three tests after those two are REFERENCE, not regression: they assert what
``field_service`` and ``api/v1/fields.py`` already did before this batch and
still do after it, and they are green either way. They are kept because the
tripl-0zpq.222 fix is written as "mirror ``field_service._on_main``", and that
claim is worth something only if the thing being mirrored is itself held still.
Do not count them toward this batch's regression coverage.
