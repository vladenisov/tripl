"""What the digest watermark's compare-and-set actually guarantees (tripl-0zpq.110).

Three comments used to credit the compare-and-set on ``last_flushed_at`` with
making "a repeated DST wall-clock time recompute the same value and lose here
instead of sending twice". It does no such thing and cannot: the autumn fold
resolves one wall time to two UTC instants an hour apart, the predicate is
``last_flushed_at < fire_at``, and two distinct instants both pass it. A reader
who trusted that sentence would have read the fold pair as the bug it claimed to
prevent and collapsed it in ``_utc_instants`` — deleting a real hour of fires
from every sub-daily cadence, once a year.

What the claim buys is single flight per FIRE INSTANT: every tick inside one
window recomputes the same ``fire_at``, so only the first can move the watermark
past it. Both halves are pinned below by replaying the flusher's scheduled arm
over a tick grid — the same ``previous_fire_at`` call, the same "claim only if
strictly newer than the watermark" test as the UPDATE in
``alert_flush.flush_due_alert_digests``.

Deliberately NOT re-proved here, because they are already pinned elsewhere:

* that the losing tick then sends nothing at all (the database half) —
  ``test_alert_digest_delivery.test_a_second_flush_inside_the_same_window_sends_nothing``
  and its Postgres twin in ``test_alert_digest_concurrency_pg.py``;
* that the SPRING gap resolves forward to a single instant —
  ``test_batch4_schedule.py`` (tripl-0zpq.280). The gap case appears below only
  as the contrast the corrected comments now draw: a gap collapses to one
  window, a fold does not collapse at all.
