"""Batch 7, lane R2 — event types, the scan binding that guards them, and the lookup.

Every behaviour below shipped in this batch with no test at all.

tripl-0zpq.254 — ``scan_configs.event_type_id`` is ``ON DELETE SET NULL``, so
deleting a bound event type never failed: it silently unbound every scan that
named it, and an unbound config with no ``event_type_column`` discovers nothing
from the data, so it went on listing and running and collecting zero events.
Both doors that can delete an event type now refuse first — the CRUD delete
(``event_type_service.delete_event_type``) and a branch merge that removed the
type (``plan_branch_merge_service._apply_merge``) — through the one predicate in
``scan_config_lookup.scan_configs_binding_event_types``. The 409 they share is
``event_type_binding_conflict_detail``, which has a singular and a plural
wording; both are exercised here.

That predicate is scoped to the project asking, like every other query in
``scan_config_lookup``. Its result is RENDERED — the 409 names each blocking
scan — so an unscoped answer would show one project's operator a scan belonging
to another project and block a delete they have no way to unblock: the remedy
the sentence offers is not reachable from the project they are in.

tripl-u2h9.12 / tripl-0zpq.123 — a scan resolves its types against MAIN's plan,
so a shadow candidate always carries a main event type id. Writing that id onto
a row authored on a working branch is what ``create_event`` now refuses
outright, which would have taken the whole branch-accept flow with it.
``reconciliation_service._event_type_on_branch`` translates the DETECTED id onto
the accept branch by name, and answers 422 when the branch has no such type.
