"""Batch 4, demo lane: what the seeded demo claims about its own signals.

Two seeder defects, both on the surface a new operator reads first.

``tripl-0zpq.247`` — the seeded failed delivery must survive its own Retry.
The local demo sink cannot fail on its own, so the demo
deliberately seeds one FAILED delivery — otherwise the failed-delivery state and
the **Retry** action the docs promise (website/docs/use/alerting.md) are
unreachable without leaving a zero-egress demo.

Retry re-dispatches that row through the real ``send_alert_delivery``, which
re-renders the message from ``delivery.items`` and OVERWRITES
``payload_snapshot["rendered_message"]`` with the result. While the seeded
failed row owned no items, the one retry the demo exists to demonstrate replaced
the seeded message with a header counting ``matched_count`` signals above an
empty list, and left the row reading "sent" with nothing in it.

The retry test runs the REAL worker body rather than stubbing ``.delay`` —
which is precisely what let this ship past
``test_demo_project.py::test_demo_seeds_a_retryable_failed_delivery`` — against
a file-backed sqlite copy of a genuinely seeded demo, under the suite's
outbound-network tripwire. A file is needed because the seeding half is async
and the worker body is sync: they cannot share ``conftest``'s single pooled
in-memory connection.

``tripl-0zpq.249`` — the "Injected demo spike" chart marker must name the bucket
the spike was injected into. The warehouse builder writes the spike into the
newest stored hour, but the marker was dated ``ctx.now``: the still-open hour,
one hourly bucket further on, which no series has a point for. The marker
therefore explained a bucket the chart does not plot — snapped onto the dashed
forecast point on the default hourly view, and onto an ordinary hour right after
the spike once the demo runtime had appended that hour for real.
