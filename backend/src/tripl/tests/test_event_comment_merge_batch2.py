"""An event's discussion when the event only gets a row on main later (tripl-0zpq.122).

A branch copy of a main event reads and writes the discussion on its main twin,
so nothing hangs on the branch row. An event CREATED on a branch has no twin, so
its thread — the note typed in the New-event box included (PR #162) — hangs on
the branch row itself. The merge used to give the event a fresh main row and
leave the thread behind: main's row opened with an empty discussion, the branch
row then read through to that empty twin, and deleting the merged branch took
the rows with it through the cascade. A twin appearing without any merge — a
scan, or the same event authored on main — hid the thread just the same.
