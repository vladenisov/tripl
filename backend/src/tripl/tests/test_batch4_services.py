# to. The pairing is the point: SQLite ignores VARCHAR widths, so the failure
# these bounds remove — a Postgres StringDataRightTruncation out of the INSERT,
# surfacing as the catch-all 500 in ``main.py`` — cannot be reproduced on this
# suite at all. What CAN be pinned here is that pydantic refuses the value first,
# and that the number it refuses at is the column's own width rather than a
# plausible-looking constant. Both halves are asserted below.
#
# The two ``email_from_address`` rows arrive by a different road than the rest
# and belong to tripl-v422, not tripl-0zpq.275: that field was never declared
# with a bound, it merely inherited one from ``validate_email_address``, which
# normalises through ``email_validator`` and refuses an address over 254 octets.
# Loosening the override to ``validate_sender_address`` — which returns the
# original string so a display name survives — took that accident away, so the
# bound is declared here like every other row's.
#
# The eight destination channel rows close tripl-0zpq.275 late: the sweep
# bounded ``name`` on these two schemas and stopped, leaving four more fields on
# the very same schemas writing into bounded columns with nothing measuring
# them. ``linear_label_ids`` is the one whose contradiction was internal rather
# than hypothetical — ``_LINEAR_LABEL_LIMIT`` (20) entries of ``_LINEAR_ID_RE``'s

    resolved to be caught. The refusal now arrives as ``HTTPException(422)``
    from the service rather than a pydantic field error, so the body is a
    string instead of a list — both shapes are handled by the frontend's API
    client (``isFieldErrorArray`` falls through to the string branch), and the
    sentence an operator reads is unchanged.
