"""The SQL PostgresAdapter.validate_field_contracts builds (tripl-64n8.5).

Shape only — that the aggregate is warehouse-side, that NULLs land in the right
denominator, that a malformed number cannot make the cast explode, and that a
contract with nothing to say produces no query at all.

The *semantics* are pinned where they have to be: against a real PostgreSQL, in
``conformance/test_postgres_field_contracts_conformance.py`` (which proves this SQL
agrees with BaseAdapter's Python fallback row for row) and in the conformance gate
(which proves it agrees with ClickHouse). A string assertion cannot tell you that
``count(*) FILTER (...)`` counted the right rows; running it can.

What is NOT here: anything a second engine also has to satisfy. The row layout,
the shared verdict and the per-expectation regex probe are pinned across all four
engines at once in ``test_batch5_parity.py``, because a rule two adapters must
agree on cannot be pinned in one adapter's file.
