"""Batch 5, lane W2: the BigQuery adapter, the worker's curated-error set, and the
BigQuery half of the data-source schema.

Four defects, three modules:

* tripl-0zpq.64 -- ``_query_rows`` handed the ``_bucket`` cell through exactly as
  ``google-cloud-bigquery`` decoded it, so a DATE time column produced a
  ``datetime.date`` bucket and a DATETIME one a naive ``datetime``. The consumers
  compare that bucket against an aware window bound and store it in a
  ``timestamptz`` column: the first is a ``TypeError``, the second is a silent
  timezone-dependent write. ``BigQueryAdapter._utc_bucket_rows`` now normalizes
  column 0 on every bucketed read path.
* tripl-0zpq.66 -- the DATE-column and TIME-column rejections were bare
  ``ValueError``s, which ``worker.tasks._errors.user_facing_error`` replaces with
  "Scan failed due to an internal error.". They are ``WarehouseCapabilityError``
  now, and that type is admitted to ``_CURATED_ERRORS``.
* tripl-0zpq.67 -- ``_quote_string`` escaped the backslash and the quote but not
  the line terminators, and GoogleSQL reads a raw newline inside a quoted literal
  as an "Unclosed string literal".
* tripl-0zpq.70 -- the allowlist write path accepted 50 datasets and the schema
  browse covered 20, silently. One constant now, and the message says why.

No warehouse, no database and no Celery app: every test here drives the real
``BigQueryAdapter`` through ``object.__new__`` and a client that only records SQL,
which is the established shape for this adapter — see
``tests/test_bigquery_nested_grouping.py`` and the ZetaSQL gate in
``tests/conformance/test_bigquery_analysis.py``.

``tripl.worker.tasks._errors`` is imported directly and on purpose:
``worker/tasks/__init__.py`` is empty and that module's own imports are confined to
``tripl.core``, so it carries none of the ``celery_app`` import cycle.
``tests/test_name_format_errors.py`` already enters the same way, for the same
curated-error question.
