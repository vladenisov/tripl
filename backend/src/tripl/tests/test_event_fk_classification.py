"""Every reference to an event must be a decision, not an oversight (tripl-xfxa).

``_event_generator_merge._merge_event_into_group`` migrates a merged-away
event's rows onto the surviving group event and then calls
``session.delete(source)``. Eighteen columns FK to ``events.id``; the merge
handled six of them, and the other twelve went quietly over the cliff. Nothing
failed, nothing logged, and the loss only surfaced months later as variables
whose ``/values`` list had gone empty behind an HTTP 200.

The defect was not "somebody wrote the wrong code". It was that the list of
things a merge has to think about lived nowhere — not in a docstring, not in a
test, only in whichever columns the author happened to remember. So this module
derives that list from the schema instead, and forces every entry into one of
three buckets with a written reason. Adding a new ``ForeignKey("events.id")``
anywhere in the codebase now fails here until someone decides what a merge
should do with it.

This is a schema-shape test, not a behaviour test: it never opens a database.
The behavioural counterparts live in ``test_event_generator.py``.
