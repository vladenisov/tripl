"""Guard against drift between the live OpenAPI schema and the committed snapshot.

The committed ``backend/openapi.json`` is the source of truth the frontend
codegen (``pnpm gen:api`` -> ``src/types/api.gen.ts``) consumes. Any backend
change that alters the API surface (routes, request/response models, status
codes, etc.) changes ``app.openapi()`` and so must be reflected in the snapshot.

This test fails until the snapshot is regenerated, making schema drift visible
in code review instead of silently desynchronising the FE<->BE contract.
