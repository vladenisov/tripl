    """tripl-0qld: an EVENT's ``keywords`` is identity text, its ``body`` is evidence.

    WHAT THIS PINS AND WHY IT IS ASSERTED ON THE DOCUMENT, NOT ON A RANKING
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Two tiers of ``_search_query``'s boost ladder read ``d.keywords`` — the 3.5
    literal keyword-token tier and the 3.25 stemmed-identity tier — and the
    second one's docstring states the premise the first one also depends on. For
    EVENT documents the premise was false: ``_event_document`` joined
    ``safe_values`` (including every value a SCAN wrote) and the values-carrying
    ``_variable_context_text`` into ``keywords``, so a value harvested from
    production traffic bought unrelated events a tier above the one a correctly
    named entity can earn.

    A ranking assertion cannot pin this on its own — the relevance harness's
    ``purchase-plural`` case stayed green through the whole inversion because the
    trigram leg covered the 0.25 the ladder gave away. So the claim is asserted
    where it is exact: on the built document's two columns. The ladder-level
    consequence is asserted separately, against a real PostgreSQL, by
    ``tests/relevance/test_keyword_tier_premise.py``.

    FOUR MARKERS, ONE PER RULE
    --------------------------
    * ``authored_marker`` — a value a person typed into the spec
      (``event_service`` records ``is_authored=True``). Curated: stays in
      ``keywords``.
    * ``scanned_marker`` — the same shape of value written by a scan
      (``is_authored=False``). Body only.
    * ``harvest_marker`` — a ``VariableValue`` observed on a bound field. Body
      only, and its BINDING (``properties.probe``) stays in ``keywords``, which
      is what separates "values left" from "the context text was deleted".
