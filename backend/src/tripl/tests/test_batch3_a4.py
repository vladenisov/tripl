"""Scan jobs: blast radius, Cancel, grouped manual runs, snapshots, anchoring.

Five defects on the scan-job seam — what a run is allowed to touch, and what
"now" means to the passes that run after it:

* tripl-0zpq.43 — ``apply_event_groups`` derived its event-type list from a
  branch-blind ``SELECT DISTINCT Event.event_type_id``, so on a project with
  open working branches it folded and DELETED every branch's deep-copied
  events, while only main was reindexed afterwards.
* tripl-0zpq.44 — neither ``run_scan`` nor ``apply_event_groups`` ever read
  ``ScanJob.status`` back, so a job the user stopped was flipped to ``running``,
  rewrote the catalog and was committed ``completed`` while still carrying
  "Cancelled by user"; and neither recorded ``celery_task_id``, which left
  ``cancel_scan_job``'s revoke branch unreachable for both.
* tripl-0zpq.45 — a manual grouped run only LOOKED UP its event types by name
  and skipped the group when one was missing, while the dry run promised the
  type "would be added" and the scheduled catalog sync actually created it. Its
  review follow-up is here too: once a raw warehouse value is CREATED from, it
  has to obey the catalog's own name rule (``event_types.name`` is
  ``String(100)``, and a NULL group cell arrives as ``""``), and the dry run
  needs the matching filter so the preview refuses what the run refuses.
* tripl-0zpq.19 — ``_load_latest_generation_snapshot`` took the newest completed
  ScanJob with any summary, but only ``run_scan`` writes ``generation_snapshot``,
  so from the first collection tick after a scan every replay silently fell
  through to the heuristic rebuild.
* tripl-0zpq.18 — ``_recalculate_release_regressions`` anchored on the caller's
  collection window, so a replay of a past window replaced the current release's
  verdict with the release that was newest back then.

Sync sqlite fixtures mirror ``test_metrics_tasks.py`` and the worker-task tests
in ``test_scans.py``: a file-backed engine plus ``monkeypatch.setitem`` on the
task's ``__globals__``, which is how a Celery task body is driven here.

#
# Making the manual run CREATE what the dry run promised put a warehouse value
# straight into ``EventType(name=...)`` with no emptiness and no length check,
# while ``models.event_type`` declares ``name`` as ``String(100)``. Both grouped
# runners reach that one resolver, so this was never a manual-run-only path: the
# SCHEDULED ``catalog_sync`` calls it too.
#
# Two reachable values broke it. ``analyze_cardinality_grouped`` maps a NULL
# group cell to ``""``, so a blank name needs no exotic data at all — it created
# one nameless event type per project, which no screen can render and no user
# could have created, quietly collecting every NULL row. And an over-long value
# raised mid-flush on PostgreSQL, killing the whole run under "Scan failed due to
# an internal error."
#
# The policy is REJECT — see ``event_type_name_rejection``'s docstring for why
# truncating is worse than refusing. These tests pin both halves of it: the
# resolver refuses, and the dry run refuses the SAME values so the preview never
# promises a type the run will not accept.

# ── tripl-0zpq.19 follow-up: a snapshot never names an event that is gone ────
#
# WHAT THESE TESTS CAN AND CANNOT DO. The defect is a foreign-key violation:
# ``event_metrics.event_id``, ``event_metric_breakdowns.event_id`` and
# ``variable_values.event_id`` all reference ``events.id``, so a replay that
# rebuilds an event from a snapshot and writes its historical id after the row
# has been deleted is refused by PostgreSQL and takes the whole replay down
# mid-window. This suite runs on SQLite, which parses foreign keys and then
# ignores them, and this module's engine does not even set
# ``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`` — so no test written here can make that INSERT
# fail, and none of these pretends to.
#
# What they pin instead is the invariant one step upstream, which is where the
# fix lives and is the thing that is actually worth protecting: EVERY event id
# ``_load_latest_generation_snapshot`` hands downstream addresses a row that
# exists. ``events_by_name`` is the single chokepoint — ``chunk_processing``,
# ``metric_rows`` and ``catalog_sync``'s ``replay_events`` all read their ids
# from it and from nowhere else — so asserting on the mapping it returns is
# equivalent to asserting on what the writers receive, and it fails for the
# right reason on any database.

    The pass wipes the scan's ``ReleaseRegression``/``ReleaseComparability`` rows

    unconditionally in the same replay over whatever it wrote — with alert state
    keyed on scope, not on version. Anchored on the caller's window, a one-off
    replay of January therefore deleted September's verdict, re-derived January's
    and notified on a release that shipped eight months ago, while resetting the
    acknowledged incidents of the release actually in the field.

    DISABLE-THE-FIX: restoring the ``evaluation_end`` anchor makes this call a
