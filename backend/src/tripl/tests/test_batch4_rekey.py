"""``f4a8d3c72e19`` driven against a real database, both directions.

The revision re-keys every LIVE catalog-metric incident after tripl-0zpq.27 made
that scope project-global: N per-scan handles collapse onto one, the Inbox
decisions recorded against them merge onto the survivor, and the copy of the
handle baked into ``AlertDeliveryItem.details_path`` moves with the column. Its
own docstring says the work lives in bind-taking functions "so a test can drive
them against a real database instead of asserting SQL text", and until this file
nothing did: ``rekey_metric_incidents`` appeared in no test in the repo. What
was covered (``test_batch4_dispatch.test_the_rekey_migration_computes_exactly_
the_handle_dispatch_computes``) is the KEY — that ``_group_id`` still equals
``dispatch._correlation_group_id``. A correct key applied by a broken pass
orphans every ack and every mute in the product just as thoroughly.

So nothing here re-derives the key. Every expected handle below is computed by
calling ``dispatch._correlation_group_id`` itself — the project-global partition
for the upgrade, a config id for the downgrade — because the id this migration
must land on is defined by the product code, not by the migration's frozen copy
of it. The copy is somebody else's test; this one is about the pass.

WHAT SQLITE PROVES, and it is most of it. The merge rule, the delete-before-
repoint ordering, the re-run guard, the link rewrite and the downgrade are all
plain row behaviour, and ``uq_alert_correlation_state_project_group`` is a real
constraint under ``Base.metadata.create_all`` on SQLite too — so an
out-of-order repoint fails here exactly as it would in production
(:func:`test_the_constraint_that_forces_that_ordering_really_bites` pins that
the constraint bites at all, which is what makes the ordering assertion
load-bearing rather than decorative).

WHAT ONLY THE POSTGRES ARM CAN PROVE, at the bottom of this file:

* ``_is_metric`` and ``_metric_handle_rows`` compare a NATIVE enum column
  (``metric_scope_type``, ``anomaly_direction``) through an explicit CAST.
  SQLite stores both as VARCHAR, so the cast is a no-op there and a predicate
  that could not compile against a real enum would still pass every test above.
* alembic reaches this database through asyncpg, which prepares the statement
  and asks the SERVER to deduce one type per parameter. That is the failure
  ``f3a9b7c15d2e``'s deploy died on ("inconsistent types deduced for parameter
  $1"), before touching a row, and it is unreachable on SQLite, which binds
  client-side. It is also why ``_relink`` rewrites the URL in Python instead of
  as a ``replace()`` repeating one bind parameter.
* the unique constraint is genuinely NOT DEFERRABLE on the server. SQLite has
  no deferrable constraints to get wrong, so "not deferrable" is vacuous there.

Gated like the other PostgreSQL gates: skipped without ``TRIPL_TEST_PG_URL``, a
failure when ``TRIPL_TEST_PG_REQUIRED=1`` says CI must not skip it.
