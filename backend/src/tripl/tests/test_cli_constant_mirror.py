"""Guard against drift between this backend's scheduler and the CLI's copy of it.

``tripl doctor`` reports the metrics scheduler's retry backoff and judges scan
staleness, and to do that ``cli/`` MIRRORS six facts declared here. The mirror is
deliberate — the cli package has no backend dependency, because it installs on an
operator's laptop — but until this file nothing tied the copies together: the
CLI's own pinning test compares its formula to literals inside its own package,
so it cannot see the backend at all, and its CI job runs from ``cli/``. A backend
change therefore left every CLI test green while ``deferred_by_seconds_estimate``,
the published backoff table in ``website/docs/run/cli.md`` and the demo staleness
allowance all quietly became wrong (tripl-ey6j.8).

The guard lives HERE rather than in ``cli/tests/`` because this is the suite whose
CI job has the whole repository checked out. It reads the two CLI modules as text
via ``ast`` — importing them would need the cli package installed, and this test
must cost the backend nothing. Same shape as ``test_alembic_revisions.py``: cheap,
structural, and it names both sides of the mismatch so the message alone is enough
to fix it.
