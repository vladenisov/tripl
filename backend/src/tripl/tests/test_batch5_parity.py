"""Batch 5, the cross-engine parity lane: one contract, four warehouse engines.

Shared file. Each agent in this lane appends its own section below and leaves the
sections above it alone; the fakes at the top are common ground.

``tripl-0zpq.68`` — ``BaseAdapter``'s top-N breakdown contract, plus a row layout
the same file contradicted itself about.

* The ABC promised the top ``values_limit`` values "ranked deterministically".
  Both halves were wrong. Every implementation keeps ``values_limit - 1``,
  because ``'Other'`` takes one of the slots; and none of the three SQL adapters
  ranked deterministically at all — their top-values pre-query ordered by count
  alone, so two equally-counted values at the cutoff could swap places between
  two rankings of the same window, and the value at the boundary lands in its
  own series one time and inside ``'Other'`` the next. The cut now lives in
  exactly one docstring, and all three SQL adapters carry the value tie-break
  the in-memory adapter already had.
* Separately, the row layouts stated for ``get_time_bucketed_aggregate`` and
  ``get_time_bucketed_aggregate_breakdown`` omitted the ``keep_json_value``
  block both of them emit, while the four count methods documented it.

These are fake-client tests: nothing here contacts a warehouse. A SQL string
proves shape, not validity, so the new ORDER BY keys are only *executed* by
``tests/conformance/`` (live credentials, skipped otherwise). What they do prove
is that the ranking key is present on every entry point of every engine, which
is the part a live one-engine run cannot show.

# refused it from inside the contract statement — the statement every OTHER
# expectation rides in — so one pattern took down the whole event type's contract
# check. Nothing between there and the task caught it either, so the scan failed,
# the config stayed due, and it failed again on every retry with the generic
# "Scan failed due to an internal error."

# statement, so a refusal is inert here and never fatal (the third fixed rule in
# ``BaseAdapter``'s field contract section, which this issue extends from "cannot
# be compiled" to "this engine's regex library will not take it"); and the
