"""BigQuery: nested/array columns must produce GROUP-BY-able SQL, and must still
come back as lists.

The bug this file pins down (tripl-64n8.13): ``_json_paths_expression`` returned an
``ARRAY<STRING>`` and every caller put it straight into ``GROUP BY``. GoogleSQL rejects
that outright — verified against Google's real ZetaSQL analyzer:

    GROUP BY ['a','b']                      -> Cannot GROUP BY literal values
    GROUP BY (SELECT ARRAY_AGG(...) ...)    -> Grouping by expressions of type ARRAY is
                                               not allowed

So *every* BigQuery scan touching a JSON, STRUCT/RECORD or REPEATED column was invalid
SQL that could never have run. It stayed invisible because the adapter tests assert SQL
strings against a fake client, and a fake client accepts anything.

Two invariants are therefore pinned here, because either one alone is insufficient:

1. SQL SHAPE — no array-valued expression may reach a GROUP BY. A test that only checked
   this would still pass an implementation that grouped correctly but handed the JSON
   *string* back to callers.
2. ROW CONTRACT — the grouped value must be decoded back into a ``list`` before it leaves
   the adapter. ``BaseAdapter`` documents the json-paths column as an ARRAY of paths, and
   ``cardinality._process_breakdown`` branches on ``isinstance(paths, (list, tuple))``:
   handed a raw ``'["a","user.name"]'`` string it reads the whole blob as ONE path and
   silently corrupts every cardinality count. That corruption is silent — no exception,
   no invalid SQL — so it needs its own test.
