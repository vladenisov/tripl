"""Plan-branch service regressions from the tripl-0zpq sweep, batch 2.

- tripl-0zpq.152: ``?include_diff_counts=true`` counts open branches only, so its
  cost follows the work in flight rather than the project's branch history.
- tripl-0zpq.153: ``create_branch`` takes the merge base and the deep copy inside
  one snapshot-consistent transaction, so the two describe the same main. When
  Postgres aborts that transaction as unserializable, the creation is retried
  from a clean session a bounded number of times, then answered with 409.
