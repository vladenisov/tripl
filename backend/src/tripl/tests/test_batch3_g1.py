"""Small-sample guard for the distribution-drift PSI analyzer (tripl-0zpq.103).

Raw PSI is sample-size driven: under the null hypothesis (both windows drawn
from the same mix) ``n_eff * PSI`` follows chi2(K-1). The fixed 0.1 / 0.25 bands
therefore called a sparse per-event-type scope "significant" most of the time,
purely because it had drawn a handful of events. ``compute_psi`` now floors an
absent category at half an observation *of its own window* and subtracts the
noise a window of that size and value count scores on its own before banding.

``compute_psi`` is pure arithmetic over two dicts, so every vector below is
hand-written and deterministic — no RNG, no session, no SQLite caveat.
