"""Outside the band == flagged, even where one row reports many buckets.

The detector reports a baseline for every bucket it scores (tripl-i9mt.25), but
two passes drop per-bucket rows after scoring: a bucket inside a reported trend
shift (``shifted_buckets``) loses its row to the single trend row, and an
outage's run of zeros is collapsed to one announcement
(``_collapse_outage_runs``). Those buckets sit outside their band with no row,
so the chart would draw an unflagged point outside the band. Their baselines
are withheld instead; the representative flagged bucket keeps its own.
