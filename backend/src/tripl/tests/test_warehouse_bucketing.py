"""Golden conformance suite for the warehouse bucket contract (tripl-64n8).

:mod:`tripl.core.bucketing` is the spec; this file is the executable copy of it.
Every adapter translates an interval *code* into its own dialect, and each
translation has to agree with :func:`floor_to_bucket` for the same UTC instant.
Nothing here mocks the contract — ``floor_to_bucket`` is called for real, and the
synthetic adapter (the in-memory reference) is *executed* against it rather than
having its SQL inspected.

The real adapters cannot be executed without a container, so their conformance is
pinned at the SQL-string level: the exact dialect expression each one emits for all
five intervals. Executing that SQL against live warehouses is tripl-64n8.9.

Two production bugs motivated this file, and each has a test that fails without the
fix:

* ``1w`` used to bin 7 days off the Unix epoch, which is a **Thursday** — so "weekly"
  buckets started on Thursday. See :func:`test_week_bucket_always_lands_on_monday`.
* BigQuery emitted ``TIMESTAMP_BIN``, which is not a GoogleSQL function at all, so
  every bucketed BigQuery query was a syntax error. See
  :func:`test_bigquery_bucket_sql`.
