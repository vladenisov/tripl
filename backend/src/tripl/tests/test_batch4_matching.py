"""Batch 4: the rule simulator's cooldown partition (``tripl-0zpq.42``).

``tripl.alerting_matching`` exists so the in-UI replay cannot answer a different
question from the live send path, and its module docstring promises exactly
that. The replay's cooldown key was the one place the promise was false: it
keyed on ``(scope_type, scope_ref)`` while the live clock, ``AlertRuleState``,
is unique on ``(rule_id, scan_config_id, scope_type, scope_ref)`` and
``dispatch._prepare_alert_deliveries`` reads only the running config's states.
A project runs several scan configs (the live iOS project runs three) and a rule
covers the whole project unless deliberately bound to one, so the same event can
be anomalous in two configs on the same day: live sends twice, the replay
reported once, and the what-if under-counted the rule it was asked about.

Everything here is in-memory — the matcher never touches a session — but it uses
real ``AlertRule`` / ``MetricAnomaly`` instances so the attribute names cannot
drift away from the columns the live path reads.
