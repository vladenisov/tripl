"""Batch-4 regressions for the alert SEND path (``worker/tasks/alerts.py``).

Named for its batch, the way ``test_batch3_a1.py``…``test_batch3_g1.py`` are.
The Telegram seeding these tests need already exists in ``test_alerting.py``
and is imported rather than copied: a second copy of a 100-line delivery
fixture stops matching the first the moment the model gains a column — and the
model just gained one. What is covered here is what a send does to the DELIVERY
ROW: what the Inbox is told when a message is refused (tripl-0zpq.40), which
worker is allowed to send at all when two are handed the same delivery
(tripl-0zpq.37), and whether the destination's own toggle is still on by the
time the message actually goes out (tripl-0zpq.39, which covers the scheduled
digest's send task as well as the per-delivery one) — and, once a send is
resumed rather than started, what the message it puts in the chat CLAIMS about
the delivery it is finishing (tripl-0zpq.35). The scheduled digest's own send
task is here for the same reason, on the question of what it leaves in the row
when one of its groups fails and a later one does not (tripl-0zpq.32) — and on
which of the members it was handed it is allowed to send at all, which is
tripl-0zpq.37 again, asked from the digest side.

One set of cases at the end is about the row's SETTINGS rather than the row:
which From: addresses the send path will accept, against which ones the two
diagnostics and the settings form accept (tripl-0zpq.29). Those reach past
``alerts.py`` on purpose — the same question is answered in
``alerts_channels._send_digest_to_destination`` for the weekly plan digest and
in ``EmailSettingsUpdate`` for the form that stores the value — because a
single-file test of the answer is exactly what let the four sites disagree.

    """The failed delivery names the items that went out — not twice as many.

    website/docs/use/alerting.md promises a delivery refused for length is
    marked failed "saying how many of its items had already gone out". The send
    loop feeds every landed part to TWO accumulators — ``delivered_items``, and
    ``already_delivered_ids`` which ``_record_delivered_items`` tops up in
    place — so summing their lengths counted this attempt's parts twice. The
    line under test is the numerator of that sentence in
    ``worker/tasks/alerts.py``: reverting it to
    ``len(already_delivered_ids) + len(delivered_items)`` makes ``reported``
    below exactly double ``landed``, and a delivery could announce more items
    delivered than it has (the filed case read "32 of 24").

    The refusal has to arrive AFTER a part has landed or the bug is invisible:
    with nothing delivered yet ``delivered_items`` is empty and both versions
    of the sentence agree. Telegram therefore refuses here on the second call
    rather than on length. The real trigger — one item over 4096 units on its
    own — cannot be seeded through this fixture, because the only oversized
    text it can inject is the rule's message template, which prefixes EVERY
    part and would get the first message refused too.

    ``send_alert_delivery`` on age alone, and ``task_acks_late`` can re-queue

    one posting it by itself, one about to fold it into a digest. The claim is
    what makes the second DROP it rather than fail it — the other worker owns
    that member's outcome, and what is left is still exactly one message per

    Three members, one Slack destination, three rules that all take the

    ``already_failed`` is the OTHER row the claim keeps out: its
    compare-and-set requires `pending`, while the ``pending`` list above only

    Replace the ``claimed = [...]`` comprehension in ``alert_digest_send`` with

    ``already_failed`` comes back `sent` with
    ``_EARLIER_FAILURE`` erased, and the second run reports "already_sent"
    rather than "already_claimed" because the batch consumed a member it never
    owned — which is the duplicate section in the reader's channel that the

    the ticket paths have no crash-window protection, or deletes the commit
