"""Guard the troubleshooting docs against drifting from the suppression rule.

``_SUPPRESSING_INBOX_STATUSES`` decides which inbox decisions stop a delivery,
and two troubleshooting checklists MIRROR it in prose: the "Alerts never fire"
item in ``website/docs/use/troubleshooting.md`` and the "My alert never fired"
note in ``website/docs/use/user-guide.md``. Both exist to answer "the rule is on,
the destination is on, and nothing arrives" — so a status missing from either
list is not a typo, it is a page that cannot diagnose the case it was written for.

That is not hypothetical. ``acknowledged`` joined the tuple when an operator who
had acked an incident kept being paged for it every hour (tripl-jfm3.91), and
both checklists were left naming only three of the four. For months the docs
therefore told a reader whose alerts were silenced by their own acknowledge to go
look at cooldowns and destinations, and nothing in either suite noticed
(tripl-pyo9). Prose cannot be type-checked, but it can be required to contain the
words.

Same shape as ``test_cli_constant_mirror.py``: structural, cheap, reads the docs
as TEXT, and names both sides of the mismatch so the failure message alone is
enough to fix it. It lives in the backend suite for the same reason that one
does — this is the CI job with the whole repository checked out.

It deliberately asserts only PRESENCE, in the right section. Wording, ordering
and emphasis stay the writer's business; what may not happen again is a status
that suppresses deliveries and is nowhere on the page people bring that symptom
to.
