"""Demo scans + governance (epic tripl-2su6.4).

The demo's scan surface is a local synthetic warehouse: scan history, coverage,
and reconciliation are seeded coherently with the scanned volume, and the real
warehouse-facing data path (Preview / Run now / Replay) works over the synthetic
source with no network. Full Celery worker-transition E2E lives in tripl-2su6.10.
