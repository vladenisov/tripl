"""Batch 4, the Copilot review of PR #169: the metric-state creation race.

``uq_alert_rule_state_metric_scope`` — the partial unique index batch 4 added
over the NULL ``scan_config_id`` space — DETECTS a duplicate project-global
metric state. It does not make the creation of one race-safe, and adding it
turned a survivable bug into a fatal one.

The race is real and it is the ordinary configuration, not a corner:

* ``metrics/schedule.check_metrics_due`` dispatches
  ``collect_metrics.delay(str(config.id), str(job.id))`` PER SCAN CONFIG, so a
  project with two configs runs two ``collect_metrics`` in two workers at once.
* A ``metric`` scope is project-global: its anomaly row carries a NULL
  ``scan_config_id`` and so does its ``AlertRuleState``, which is exactly why
  both of those runs load, and want to create, the SAME state row
  (``dispatch._scope_partition_id``). ``signals._get_active_metric_anomaly_candidates``
  already says so in as many words: "This pass runs once per scan config while
  the anomalies it judges are project-global and share ONE ``AlertRuleState``
  row".
* ``dispatch._prepare_alert_deliveries`` loaded that row and, on a miss,
  inserted it — a check-then-act with the two halves in different statements
  and, across workers, in different transactions.

Before the index, the loser of that race merely wrote a SECOND project-global
row: one cooldown clock per config, which is the duplicate the index exists to
forbid. With the index the loser's INSERT violates it, and nothing wraps
``_prepare_alert_deliveries`` in a savepoint — so the IntegrityError takes the
whole ``collect_metrics`` run down with it, discarding the anomaly
recalculation, the cooldown updates and every delivery for every scope of that
scan, on every collection for as long as the scope keeps firing. That is the
tripl-0zpq.253 blast radius reached from a different direction, and batch 4 is
what made it reachable.

The fix is ``dispatch._claim_rule_state``: an INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
that converges instead of raising, with the row re-read afterwards — the shape
``_buffer_pending_items`` uses for the digest buffer and ``detect.py`` for its
anomaly rows. Its RETURNING clause is the SEND CLAIM: the run whose INSERT
actually landed owns the notification, and the run that lost adopts the row
already there and stays quiet for that collection instead of shipping the peer's
alert a second time.

Three properties are pinned below, because a fix for one is easy to write
without the others:

* CONVERGENCE. A racing sibling no longer kills the collection.
* NO DUPLICATE. The loser does not deliver. A "catch the IntegrityError,
  re-select, then carry on through the ordinary gate" fix passes the first and
  fails this one: the peer's row has ``last_notified_at IS NULL`` at that
  instant, which is the arm of the gate that sends.
* NOTHING LOST. ``last_notified_at`` is stamped only on a SUCCESSFUL send, so a
  peer whose delivery never lands leaves the NULL that makes the NEXT collection
  deliver. Silence for one tick, not a swallowed alert.

The race cannot be staged with two real connections here: SQLite admits one
writer at a time, and ``_prepare_alert_deliveries`` has already opened a write
transaction (``_retire_config_anchored_metric_states`` issues a DELETE) by the
time the claim runs, so a competitor on a second connection would meet
"database is locked" rather than the unique index. The competitor is therefore
written through the SAME connection at the last line before the claim, which is
precisely where a concurrent commit sits — the pattern
``test_event_generator.py`` uses for the event-identity race, for the same
reason and with the same caveat. What is under test is what the database does
when a second INSERT of the same key arrives, and that is identical either way.
The PostgreSQL-only half — which unique index the ON CONFLICT names — is pinned
by compiling the real statement against the real dialect.

THE SAME BUG ONE TABLE OVER: the incident row.

``_touch_correlation_state`` was the other select-then-``session.add`` in this
module, and batch 4 made it collidable for the same reason. Its key is
``uq_alert_correlation_state_project_group`` on ``(project_id,
correlation_group_id)``, and since tripl-0zpq.27 the handle in that second column
is the same in every worker by design: it hashes the scope's PARTITION, which for
a project-global ``metric`` scope is one shared NULL. Before that change each
scan hashed its own firing config and the two runs wrote DIFFERENT rows, so the
collision could not happen — agreeing on one handle is the fix, and it is also
what made the row's creation a race.

``_claim_rule_state`` does NOT settle this one. It serialises the creation of a
rule STATE, and ``AlertRuleState`` carries no ``direction`` while the incident
handle does. So a scope that dropped in the morning and spikes in the afternoon
reuses the single state row it already has — both racing runs take the branch for
an EXISTING state, where nothing is claimed — and then touches a second,
brand-new handle. That flip is the ordinary case: 106 of 223 live scopes fired in
BOTH directions inside one day (``dispatch._buffer_pending_items``).

The constraint is a plain, non-deferrable UNIQUE — ``f4a8d3c72e19`` deletes
losers before re-pointing a survivor precisely because of it — so the loser's
INSERT raised IntegrityError at the next flush and took the collection with it,
exactly as the rule-state race did.

Same fix, same shape: INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, then re-read. Two
details are specific to this table and are pinned below:

* DO NOTHING is not a preference here, it protects the OPERATOR. That row holds
  an inbox decision — ``status``, ``muted_until``, ``note``, ``acted_at``,
  ``false_positive_count`` — and a collection has no business restating any of
  it.
* ``last_seen_at`` advances in PYTHON after the re-read, not in a SET clause,
  because the two backends have no shared spelling of a maximum. PostgreSQL's
  ``GREATEST`` IGNORES a NULL argument; SQLite's two-argument ``max()`` RETURNS
  NULL if any argument is NULL. On a row whose ``last_seen_at`` is still NULL —
  which is every row an operator created from the Inbox, see
  ``_alerting_deliveries._get_or_create_correlation_state`` — the identical SET
  clause would set the stamp in production and erase it in this suite.

No network, and the DB is a throwaway sqlite file.

    Revert ``_touch_correlation_state`` to the ``select`` / ``if state is None:
    session.add(AlertCorrelationState(...))`` it replaced and the
    ``session.flush()`` below raises ``IntegrityError`` on
    ``uq_alert_correlation_state_project_group`` — so this reddens on the flush,
    before any assertion.

    Dropping only the ``DO NOTHING``, leaving a bare INSERT, does NOT redden this
    test: there is no row when the collection runs, so that insert lands and it
    is the peer's converging one that swallows the collision. What catches that
    edit is the SQL-shape test at the bottom of this file, which is why it is
    there.

    That flush is where the reverted code fails because ``session.add`` DEFERS:
    the old select missed, the object went into the session unwritten, and the
    peer landed in the gap before anything flushed it. On this seed — one
    destination, one rule, one anomaly — ``_prepare_alert_deliveries`` issues no
    further statement after the touch, so that gap reaches the line below. In
    production it closes at whatever the collection does next: a second rule, a
    second destination, or the commit. Nothing about the collision depends on how
    long it lasts — only on a second INSERT of this key arriving inside it.

    The assertions then pin what converging has to leave behind:

    * ONE row for the handle, which is what the constraint is for.
    * It is THIS run's row, not the peer's: this run's INSERT went first and won,
      and the peer's DO NOTHING is the half that converged. The sibling test
      above is the mirror image — there the peer won — and between them they say
      the outcome does not depend on who arrives first.
