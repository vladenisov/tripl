"""The two digest-flush guards that only exist on PostgreSQL (tripl-o3ry).

``test_alert_digest_delivery.py`` runs on SQLite, where both of these are
silent no-ops: ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` emits nothing, and
``_try_acquire_advisory_lock`` returns ``(None, True)`` without asking the
database (``metrics/schedule.py``). So the guards that keep
``flush_due_alert_digests`` safe under concurrency were unproven by the suite
even though every assertion in it passed.

Skipped honestly when no PostgreSQL is reachable, so a local ``pytest`` run
stays green — and CI sets ``TRIPL_TEST_PG_REQUIRED=1``, which turns
"database unreachable" from a skip into a failure, because a gate that can
silently skip itself in CI is not a gate. Same stance as the warehouse
conformance harness (``tests/conformance/conftest.py``).

Point a local run at any empty database:

    docker run -d --name pg -e POSTGRES_USER=tripl -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=tripl \
        -e POSTGRES_DB=tripl_digest -p 55432:5432 postgres:18
    TRIPL_TEST_PG_URL=postgresql+psycopg://tripl:tripl@localhost:55432/tripl_digest \
        uv run pytest src/tripl/tests/test_alert_digest_concurrency_pg.py
