"""Per-metric anomaly coverage, and the cost of computing it.

Two defects on the same seam:

* tripl-0zpq.6 — every monitored catalog metric was handed the RUNNING scan's
  ``covered_buckets`` while being scored on its OWN grid, so a metric on a
  different interval had its series decimated by ``expand_series`` and a metric
  sourced from a different scan config was judged by someone else's outages.
  ``_replace_scope_anomalies`` then rewrote the metric's whole trailing window
  from whatever survived.
* tripl-0zpq.25 — ``covered_buckets_from_scan_jobs`` read every completed
  ``ScanJob`` and every distinct ``EventMetric.bucket`` for a config's entire
  lifetime on every scheduled collection, to build a set the detector only ever
  consults back to its own ``history_from``.

Sync sqlite fixtures mirror ``test_metric_anomaly_scope.py``.
