"""Batch 6, lane B: catalog-metric series and the metrics read path.

Regression tests for four findings in ``services/metric_series_service``:

* ``tripl-0zpq.113`` — breakdowns zero-filled FRACTIONAL series because
  ``get_metric_breakdowns`` was the only caller that never passed
  ``count_shaped``.
* ``tripl-0zpq.114`` — the version fold ADDED ratios together, so a ~30% metric
  plotted its "Other" line at 85%.
* ``tripl-0zpq.115`` — the value read mixed every scan grid's ``MetricValue``
  rows, so a two-grid ``event_composition`` metric plotted the retired grid and
  invented a zero where the live one had data. The repair is a GRID POPULATION
  shared by the read and the detector (``_grid_population_filter`` /
  ``detect._metric_grid_population``): SUM every config on the resolved grid's
  interval, exclude every other. The first attempt narrowed to the single
  resolved config instead, which left the plotted line one ADDEND of the band
  drawn around it, so ``TestMetricGridIsolation`` pins both halves — too narrow
  and too wide each redden a different test in it.
* ``tripl-0zpq.116`` — a stored non-finite value 500'd the whole series read on
  ``round()``.

and for four more in ``services/metrics_service``, the event-metrics read path:

* ``tripl-0zpq.111`` — ``get_events_metrics`` filtered by the BRANCH copy's
  event-type id, which no metric row carries, so every tab's Dynamics card was
  empty on a working branch.
* ``tripl-0zpq.112`` — the scan's ``platform_column`` never reached the
  Breakdowns tab's column list, making the stored per-platform series and its
  parity badges unreachable.
* ``tripl-0zpq.117`` — ``get_platform_presence`` hydrated one row per (event,
  platform, bucket) of the scan's whole history to build a set.
* ``tripl-0zpq.118`` — ``get_data_source_stats`` summed event-level AND
  type-level ``event_metrics`` rows, double-counting matched volume.

and for five that span both plus ``services/metrics_insights_service``:

* ``tripl-0zpq.100`` — every read path fitted an STL/MSTL on the event loop,
  including a per-event batch that threw the result away.
* ``tripl-0zpq.119`` / ``tripl-0zpq.299`` — the served band was drawn from a
  sigma no API writes and, on catalog series, from the un-floored stddev.
* ``tripl-0zpq.120`` — the version-activation rule documented for fractional
  metrics was not the rule the code applies.
* ``tripl-0zpq.200`` — a non-UUID ``scope_ref`` 500'd the seasonality heatmap.

Fixtures and seeding helpers are reused from ``test_metric_series_api`` and
``test_metrics_api`` (the sibling suites for these endpoints) rather than
re-declared, the way the ``test_batch4_*`` modules reuse their neighbours'.

        A ``MetricAnomaly`` says nothing about which configs it was scored from,
        so the read can only be right if the detector's population is the read's
        population. ``detect._metric_grid_population`` is the sync mirror of
        ``metric_series_service._grid_population_filter`` and this pins them to
        the same answer on one seeded shape: two live 1d sources plus a retired
        1h grid sitting in the same bucket.

        Both halves redden:

        * drop the population predicate from ``_load_metric_value_points`` (what
          it did before this repair) and the retired grid's 100.0 is added to the
          daily bucket — ``[110.0, 5.0]``;

          tripl-0zpq.115 originally proposed) and the sibling daily source drops
          out — ``[3.0, 5.0]``.

        ``_metric_source_config_ids`` is asserted alongside because it is the
        coupled function: it feeds the coverage UNION, and coverage that
        describes a different population than the series either vouches for
        buckets that are no longer in it (the retired grid) or drops buckets only
        the sibling contributed — ``expand_series`` EXCLUDES an uncovered bucket
        rather than zero-filling it.

        ``grid`` is deliberately not passed to ``_load_metric_value_points``:
        the default has to resolve the same population, because
