"""Batch 18 merge-time races: tripl-0zpq.288, .290 and .294.

One mechanism closes all three (``services/_plan_branch_locks.py``): a plan
write holds its branch's ``plan_branches`` row ``FOR SHARE`` in its own
transaction, and a merge holds the merged branch's row ``FOR UPDATE`` and
main's ``FOR NO KEY UPDATE`` from before it reads either plan to its commit.

The locks exist only on PostgreSQL, so the interleavings live in the
``postgres`` tests at the bottom: the real app, on a real database, with two
requests in flight at once and the merge held open at a chosen point. They skip
without ``TRIPL_TEST_PG_URL`` and fail when ``TRIPL_TEST_PG_REQUIRED=1`` finds
no database, like every other PostgreSQL gate (see
``test_alert_digest_concurrency_pg``). The SQLite tests at the top pin what can
be shown without concurrency: which requests take which lock, that the merge
takes main's before it reads main, and that the helpers are no-ops off
PostgreSQL.
