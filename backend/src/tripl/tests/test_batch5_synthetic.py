"""Batch-5 regression tests for the synthetic warehouse and the demo catalog.

Five findings, all of which produced a WRONG NUMBER rather than an error, so
every test here asserts a value relationship rather than "something came back":

* tripl-0zpq.71 — the adapter could not read the dialect it declares. Every
  filter the metric collector compiled for it (back-tick quoted, backslash
  escaped) matched nothing on ``=`` and everything on ``!=``, and the per-metric
  collection path's row filter — delivered by WRAPPING the source in a
  ``WHERE`` subquery — was thrown away entirely.
* tripl-0zpq.73 — every row digest was keyed on its offset from the anchor, and
  the anchor moves on every scan, so the same absolute hour held different rows
  each time and session pools rolled over at the anchor's hour instead of UTC
  midnight.
* tripl-0zpq.76 — the seeded sql-metric shape was recognized by probing for
  three substrings, so an edited query was answered with the unfiltered series.
* tripl-0zpq.79 — a capability error that could not be surfaced, a budget guard
  that could not fire, and a connection test that could not fail.
* tripl-0zpq.80 — orders were stamped up to 24h into the future while events
  stopped at the last complete hour.
