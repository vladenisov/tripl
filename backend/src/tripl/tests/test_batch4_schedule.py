"""A cadence whose hour falls in the spring DST gap (tripl-0zpq.280).

``core.alert_schedule`` promises a nonexistent local time folds FORWARD — a
"daily at 02:30" digest on the morning the clocks jump 02:00 -> 03:00 goes out
at 03:30 local, an hour late, because skipping it is a silent 24h outage.

``_utc_instants`` used to return BOTH of ``fold``'s answers for that wall time.
In a gap the second answer is not a second reading of the same instant the way
it is on the autumn fold; it is the post-transition offset applied to a time
that never happened, which resolves 02:30 BACKWARDS to 01:30 local. The flusher
compares fire instants in UTC and has no way to tell that one of them precedes
the wall clock it was derived from, so it claimed the 01:30 window and shipped
the digest an hour EARLY — before the window it summarises had closed, at a
time the operator's schedule never named.

The tests below pin the resolved instant, not just its ordering: the existing
DST coverage in ``test_alert_schedule.py`` probes the gap day only at noon,
where ``max()`` over both candidates hides the early one entirely.
