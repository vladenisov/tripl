"""Fork-safety tests for the worker's shared sync engine.

The Celery parent may initialize the module-global sync engine before prefork
forks the worker children (``apply_startup_service_overrides`` reads the DB at
import). Forked children must drop that inherited engine so they don't share one
Postgres socket. ``dispose_engine`` performs the reset and is wired to the
``worker_process_init`` signal in ``tripl.worker.celery_app``. See tripl-q7i1.3.
