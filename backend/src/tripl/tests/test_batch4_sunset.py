"""Batch 4 — the deprecated-sunset alert (tripl-0zpq.31), both halves.

``check_deprecated_sunset_events`` was registered, callable, tested, and on
nobody's timer: no beat entry named it and nothing else invoked it, so whatever
it built could not reach a reader. It was kept rather than deleted because the
feature is already half-shipped — ``_build_plan_digest_message`` renders the
same counter, from the same predicate, to the same set of destinations, as
"- Deprecated events still receiving data: N". A count cannot name the events;
this task is that line expanded, and it is now on a daily schedule.

Wiring it made the second half urgent. ``_build_sunset_alert_message`` filtered
by project and never by branch, while every event count in the weekly digest is
scoped to the MAIN plan branch with a comment explaining why. Opening a working
branch deep-copies every event row and carries ``status``, ``sunset_at`` and
``last_seen_at`` across unchanged (``plan_branch_service``), so one overdue
event on a project with one open branch produced "Count: 2" and printed the
same event twice — while the digest, on the same data, said 1. Scheduling that
would have shipped the duplicate to real Slack and email destinations daily,
which is why neither half is landable alone.

The tests below pin each half against its own revert:

* the beat entry exists, names a REGISTERED task, and is daily;
* an open branch's copy neither duplicates a line nor moves the count;
* a branch that is only a PROPOSAL cannot raise an alert about the live plan;
* the alert and the digest agree about one project, which is the property the
  two functions' comments now claim.

Scheduling it also made the message's SIZE matter, which is section (c).
``_build_sunset_alert_message`` renders one line per overdue event, and there is
no cap anywhere between its query and the webhook — not in the builder, not in
``alerts_channels._send_slack_message``, and not in the Telegram splitter, which
this path cannot reach because the task selects only slack and email
destinations. On a daily beat to every enabled destination that made the payload
bounded by nothing but the project's deprecated-event count, and the list is
monotonic: ``last_seen_at`` only ever moves forward, so an event that was still
receiving data at its sunset date stays on it until someone acts. Section (c)
pins the cap, the tail that admits to it, and the ceiling its number was chosen
against:

* the list is capped, says how many events it is not showing, and leaves
  ``Count:`` the true total the digest is compared against;
* the capped message fits Slack's ``text`` field even at the widest name the
  ``events.name`` column allows.

The final section belongs to a different issue in the same lane
(crosslane-35-33) and is here because this lane owns one test file. It covers
what a RESUMED Telegram digest says about itself once the remainder needs more
than one message — the half of tripl-0zpq.35 that lives in
``alerts_messages.split_telegram_messages`` rather than in the send task, and
which the send-side test deliberately stopped short of (test_batch4_send.py's
``assert len(posts) == 1`` names it as out of its scope):

* every part of the retry summarises the WHOLE digest, not the leftovers;
* the parts continue the reader's numbering instead of restarting at one;
* a lone remaining message still says it is the last;
* the continued marker is reserved for, so it cannot overflow the ceiling;
* the send task hands the splitter both facts, and the part count it reads
  them from advances once per ACCEPTED message.

tripl-0zpq.33's other half — the ``_assert_egress_allowed`` docstring — is a
documentation correction with no behaviour to pin, and the behaviour it now
describes is already covered by test_batch4_messages.py
(``test_the_digest_send_helper_refuses_a_demo_project_on_its_own`` and
``test_the_backstop_refuses_egress_rather_than_refusing_demos``). A second copy
here would go green whatever the docstring said.

``_build_delivery_snapshot``'s ``app_base_url`` paragraph (crosscut-6) is the
same shape of correction. It claimed to be "the SECOND ``_build_item_paths``
call" when ``dispatch._create_deliveries`` freezes the snapshot right after the
flush and BEFORE the loop that mints the typed rows, and it justified the
required argument by the snapshot not "disagree[ing] with the rows beside it
about the same item" — which they always do for an ordinary scope, because the
snapshot passes no ``correlation_group_id`` and the row call does, so the two
take different arms of ``_build_item_paths``. The paragraph now states the
reason that holds (one read of the setting, so the two encodings cannot
disagree about the BASE) and names the shape divergence as deliberate. The
divergence itself is already pinned by test_batch4_dispatch.py's
``test_the_typed_items_and_the_frozen_snapshot_cannot_disagree_about_a_link``,
which counts six links for two items — two typed audit URLs plus the snapshot's
event-details + monitoring pair each — and asserts they share one base. A test
here would restate that and stay green whatever the docstring said.
