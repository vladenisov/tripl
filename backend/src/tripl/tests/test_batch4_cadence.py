"""Batch 4, the cadence lane: switching a destination back to "Immediately".

tripl-0zpq.38 — a held scope is delivered by exactly ONE of the two paths.

A destination on a cadence holds its matched signals in ``alert_pending_items``
instead of delivering them. Turning the cadence off used to leave that buffer
in place, and TWO independent things then shipped it:

* the IMMEDIATE path, because a held scope has never been sent, so its
  ``AlertRuleState.last_notified_at`` is still NULL and
  ``dispatch._prepare_alert_deliveries`` fires on a NULL regardless of the
  rule's cooldown; and
* the flusher's DRAIN arm, which mints a digest from any buffer sitting under a
  destination with no cadence, within a minute of the switch.

Both fire off the same rows, so an operator who asked for immediate alerts got
every held scope twice. The fix puts the handoff where the transition happens —
``_alerting_destinations.update_destination`` SPLITS the buffer in the same
transaction that clears the column — and the split is on the one column
dispatch's re-send gate actually reads:

* ``AlertRuleState.last_notified_at`` NULL — nobody was ever told about this
  scope, the gate fires on the NULL regardless of cooldown, so the row is
  DISCARDED and the immediate path delivers it. It re-reads the scope, so what
  arrives is the current number rather than a reading up to a cadence period
  old;
* STAMPED — a digest this destination already sent reported this scope, because
  ``alerts._stamp_rule_state`` runs for a digest send exactly as it does for an
  immediate one. The gate then needs a strictly newer bucket AND an elapsed
  cooldown, and neither holds at the switch, so the row is KEPT and the drain
  arm ships it.

Discarding the whole buffer instead — on the premise that a held scope "has
never been sent, so its ``last_notified_at`` is still NULL" — is only safe for a
destination that has never shipped a digest. ``AlertRuleState`` carries no
direction while a buffered row does, so a held DROP sits on the state row an
unrelated SPIKE stamped, with its own ``correlation_group_id`` and its own Inbox
card; discarding it destroys an incident nothing re-offers and leaves the scope
silent for up to ``cooldown_minutes``. That is the same trap
``dispatch._buffer_pending_items`` argues against, and the same one the drain
arm refuses to filter on ``last_notified_at`` to avoid: the predicate would
destroy a buffered DROP whenever an unrelated SPIKE on the same scope was sent.

The drain arm keeps its other job too — rows that COMMIT after the switch, from
an in-flight ``collect_metrics`` that read the cadence before it was cleared.

Sync sqlite fixtures mirror ``test_alert_digest_delivery.py``. The service is
async and the worker is sync, so both run against one sqlite FILE rather than
the suite's shared in-memory engine — that is the only way one test can drive
the operator's PATCH and then the two delivery paths it decides between.
