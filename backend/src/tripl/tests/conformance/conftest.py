"""Warehouse wiring for the conformance gates: connect, seed, and skip honestly.

Two rules govern everything here.

**A developer without Docker must not be blocked.** An unreachable warehouse
SKIPS, it does not error, so ``uv run pytest`` on a laptop stays green.

**CI must not be allowed to skip.** A skip in CI means a container failed to come
up, and a gate that silently no-ops reports green while testing nothing — which is
strictly worse than having no gate at all. Setting ``TRIPL_CONFORMANCE_REQUIRED=1``
(CI does) turns every "warehouse unreachable" skip into a hard FAILURE. The CI job
additionally asserts, from the JUnit XML, that a non-zero number of conformance
tests actually ran and that none of them skipped.

#: * The UPSERTs are dialect-branched (``_upsert_metric_values_rows`` and friends
#:   pick ``sqlite_insert`` or ``pg_insert`` off ``session.bind``). Every existing
#:   test drives the SQLite branch; production runs the PostgreSQL one. This gate
