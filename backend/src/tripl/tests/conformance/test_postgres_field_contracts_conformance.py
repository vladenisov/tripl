"""PostgreSQL field contracts, executed against a real server (tripl-64n8.5).

The assertion that matters is here: **the warehouse-side SQL and BaseAdapter's
Python fallback must return the same violations from the same rows.** The fallback
is the reference semantics (it is what ClickHouse's native validator was itself
written against), so pinning the two together is what makes "PostgreSQL now
validates natively" a statement about correctness rather than about speed.

And then the one thing the fallback CANNOT do: a violation that first appears at
row 50,001 is invisible to it, because it only ever looks at the first 50,000 rows.
``test_a_violation_past_the_sampling_limit...`` seeds exactly that table and shows
the fallback reporting a clean bill of health while the native validator finds it.

Needs a PostgreSQL. Unreachable => SKIP, so a laptop without Docker stays green:
