"""The one canonical fixture dataset every warehouse conformance gate seeds.

One dataset, three warehouses: the same rows are loaded into PostgreSQL and
ClickHouse and rendered as a table-less GoogleSQL literal for BigQuery, so a
divergence between two adapters is a real divergence and not a fixture artifact.

The timestamps are not arbitrary. They are chosen so that a *timezone-shifted*
window returns the SAME NUMBER OF ROWS as the correct one, but a DIFFERENT SET of
rows — the exact shape of the bug this suite exists to catch. A gate that only
compared counts would have passed against the broken code.

This file holds TWO rowsets. ``ROWS`` (below) is the scan/bucket trap the adapter
gates run on. ``PIPELINE_ROWS`` (further down) is the time SERIES the pipeline gate
runs on — scan, event generation, event metrics, fact metrics and drift need a
baseline plus a spike, which nine rows cannot carry. Both are seeded into both
executing warehouses from the same place, and both derive every expectation from
``floor_to_bucket``, so neither can drift from the product's own bucketing.

Concretely, the correct window is ``[2026-04-02T00:00Z, 2026-04-09T00:00Z)`` and
selects ids 1-7 (seven rows). Reading the window bounds as ``Asia/Kolkata``
wall-clock (UTC+05:30) — which is what an offset-less SQL literal does on a
non-UTC server — slides it to ``[2026-04-01T18:30Z, 2026-04-08T18:30Z)``, which
drops id 7 and picks up id 9: still seven rows, a different seven. Hence every
timezone assertion here compares row MEMBERSHIP, never row count.
