"""Which owner-only routes an API key may pass, and which stay browser-only.

Owner-only means security and instance administration, so ``get_owner_user``
refuses a Bearer token at any scope. That also blocked the bounded metrics
replay, which is why tripl-mcp ships no replay tool and the CLI dropped
``tripl scans replay`` (tripl-cj5z). The replay — and only the replay — now takes
``get_key_reachable_owner_user``, so this module pins all four corners of that
gate plus the exact route list that carries it: the value of a per-route
exception is that it stays short and reviewed.
