"""Batch 4 — what the sunset alert's EMAIL says it is.

``check_deprecated_sunset_events`` does not resolve a destination of its own:
it reuses ``alerts_channels._send_digest_to_destination``, the helper written
for ``send_weekly_plan_digest``. That helper hardcoded
``subject=f"[{project.name}] Weekly tripl digest"``, so once the sunset alert
was put on a DAILY beat (celery_app.py's ``check-deprecated-sunset-events``)
every one of its emails arrived titled "Weekly tripl digest" — wrong about the
cadence, wrong about the contents, and threaded by the reader's mail client
into the weekly digest's conversation, which is where an operator looks for
last week's summary rather than for today's work item.

The subject is now the caller's, with the weekly title as the default, so the
three things worth pinning are:

* the weekly digest's subject is byte-identical to the one it always sent —
  this is the path that was NOT meant to change;
* the sunset alert, run end to end, carries its own subject instead;
* Slack, which has no subject at all, is untouched by the new parameter.

The ``[project]`` prefix stays inside the helper, so a caller can only choose
the title. That is deliberate and is asserted below on both paths: two beats
that could each invent a subject SHAPE would eventually disagree about one.
