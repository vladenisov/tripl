"""Batch 7, R3: the branch copy and the merge, repaired after review.

tripl-0zpq.123, second half — the batch closed the write door for an event
pointing outside its own branch (``event_service`` now scopes both the event
type and the meta-field definitions it accepts) and taught the RELATION copy in
``deep_copy_plan_to_branch`` to answer 409 for the rows stored before that
refusal. The event children in the same function kept their unqualified
subscripts, so one such row still made "create a branch" a bare 500 naming
nothing, and the meta-value replay in ``_apply_merge`` made the merge one too.
Both now refuse by name.

tripl-0zpq.149 is deliberately NOT covered here any more. This file used to hold
the base arm of an ambiguous-natural-key refusal — ``_ambiguous_keys``,
``_reject_ambiguous_keys`` and the call in ``merge_branch`` — and that whole
refusal was removed after review, so the test went with it. No coverage was
lost: a branch is how an analyst CLEANS UP a pair of namesakes (delete both
copies, author one row in their place), and refusing that merge took away the
only door out of the very state it complained about, which is the workflow two
tests in ``test_event_comment_merge_batch2`` already pin. The diff still warns
on the row — ``plan_revision_service._shared_key_warning``, held by
``test_plan_revision_batch2`` — and the merge's half of the ticket waits on
tripl-0zpq.292, an origin id on branch copies, which is the one thing that lets
rows sharing a key be paired instead of refused.

tripl-0zpq.128, the main side — the KeyError guard on ``relation_key`` was added
to the branch comprehension only, while ``main_relation_by_key`` still indexed
main's event-type names unguarded.

Each test names the production line whose revert reddens it.
