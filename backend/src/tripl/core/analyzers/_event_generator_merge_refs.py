"""The event references a group merge must carry that no foreign key can find.

``_merge_event_into_group`` re-points every row whose ``event_id`` is a real FK.
This module handles the rest: an event id stored as a STRING or inside a JSON
list, invisible to database reflection and therefore invisible to the automatic
half of ``tests/test_event_fk_classification.py``. Those were found by hand while
classifying the FK ledger (tripl-avf4), together with the one real FK the ledger
had parked as a known gap (tripl-jtnv).

Split out of ``_event_generator_merge`` rather than appended to it: that module
is already past 600 lines against this repo's 800-line ceiling, and it was
itself split out of ``event_generator`` for the same reason.

**The test that decides whether a reference belongs here** is whether the row
asserts *what was true at a moment* or *what should be true from now on*. Only
the second kind is carried:

* a sensitivity override says "be stricter on this stream, permanently", and the
  stream survives as the target;
* an alert filter says "alert on this stream" / "never alert on this stream";
* a chart annotation's TEXT is history, but its ``scope_ref`` is only where the
  marker gets drawn;
* an OPEN implementation ticket says "this is not built yet" — a closed one is a
  record of what shipped, so it is left alone.

Records of the past stay frozen and are deliberately NOT here: ``plan_revisions``,
``alert_deliveries.payload_snapshot``, ``audit_log.payload``,
``scan_jobs.result_summary``, and the stored links on delivery items. Each
carries a written reason in the ledger.

Nothing in this module may raise. It runs inside ``apply_event_groups`` and
``run_scan``, whose handlers mark the whole ``ScanJob`` failed — losing a scan
because an annotation could not be re-pointed would be a far worse trade than
the dangling reference it was fixing. It also may not import ``tripl.worker``:
``core`` never does, which is why ``mark_collection_error`` moved onto the model.

    ``numerator_event_id`` / ``denominator_event_id`` are real foreign keys with

    event and event-type refs are NULL, ``_collect_event_composition`` then
    reports ``{"values": 0, "grids": 0}`` — a SUCCESS — so
    ``last_collection_status`` never goes red, and ``_event_composition_due``
    returns ``False`` forever after, so the scheduler stops trying. The metric
    flatlines with nothing anywhere saying why, while the series it wants sits
    under the target: ``_merge_event_metric_rows`` has already summed both
    events' counts onto it.

    Nothing constrains these columns (``metric_definitions`` is unique only on
    ``(project_id, name)``), so there is no fold and no target-wins rule — two
    metrics may legally name the same event.

    ONE case needs more than a re-point. If a ``ratio`` metric had its numerator
    on one merged event and its denominator on the other, both operands now name
    the same event and the metric computes a constant 1.0 on every bucket —
    arithmetic that looks healthy and means nothing. A dangling NULL is still
    worse, so the operands are re-pointed and the metric is driven red instead,
    naming both originals so an operator can see what happened and redefine it.

    that decision AND leaves the target ratcheting again from the project
    defaults, so the operator ends up with a stale row whose effect they cannot
