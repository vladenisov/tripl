"""Detection of observed variable values outside the documented lists.

Runs inside the scan's ``generate_events`` right after variable contexts are
rebuilt. Purely additive to the plan: rows are upserted on
``(variable_id, event_id)`` refreshing ``observed_values``/``detected_at``.

Because the key is the (variable, event) pair and the evidence is a mutable
payload, a resolved row would otherwise absorb every future novel value while
staying resolved — unlike ``SchemaDrift``, which keys on content and so gets a
fresh row per distinct finding. ``accepted`` rows therefore freeze: scans stop
refreshing them, and a scan reopens the row as soon as it observes a value
outside the resolved set.

The resolved set is ``observed_values`` INTERSECTED with what is documented,
not ``observed_values`` alone. Acceptance documents the values it accepts, and
absorption never did — so on any instance that ran an older build, the stored
evidence holds values nobody accepted, and reading the column at face value
would keep suppressing exactly the rows this freeze exists to fix. The
intersection is against the pair's documented list UNION the variable's global
list, because accepting globally on a pair that has an override writes to
``allowed_values`` while the override still decides what counts as novel.
Consequence worth stating: a value removed from the documented list by hand
comes back as a drift, which is the honest reading — a row cannot claim to be
resolved while holding a value the plan does not document.

``snoozed`` (time-boxed, expires on its own) and ``false_positive`` ("this
detector is wrong for this pair") stay as they were: refreshed in place,
never reopened by a scan.
