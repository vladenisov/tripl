    Two disjoint reasons to delete a row:

    * its ``(variable, event, field)`` key is in ``contexts``, so
      ``insert_variable_contexts`` is about to re-add it and the old row has to
      go first (``uq_variable_value_context``);
    * this run REWROTE the field value the row describes AND the row's variable
      is one this run is allowed to observe. A context means "this event field's
      value references ``${variable}``", so it stops being true exactly when
      ``_upsert_field_values`` changes (or newly writes) that ``(event, field)``
      value — which is what ``rewritten_fields`` carries.

    Everything else is left alone. This used to delete every context for the
    event type unconditionally, which also wiped rows the run had no opinion
    about: values enriched by an earlier replay, and — the case that surfaced it
    — a demo's seeded observed values hanging off authored field values the scan
    is not allowed to touch, so the demo's very first scan emptied its own
    "Variables & value drift" story (bd tripl-jfm3.56). The scheduled metrics
    path already merges into existing rows rather than replacing them
    (``_merge_replay_variable_samples``); this brings the scan path in line.

    ``excluded_variable_ids`` is the second arm's limit, and it is what makes the
    two arms one rule: INVALIDATE only what you could state afresh. That held
    implicitly while every row on a rewritten field was re-recorded by the same
    run, so the second arm never needed to name the variable. It stopped holding
    when excluding a variable became a tombstone instead of a purge (bd
    tripl-95pu): ``record_variable_contexts`` skips an excluded variable, so its
    rows reach ``insert_variable_contexts`` by no route at all, and a rewrite
    here destroyed observations permanently — silently, inside the scan, which is
    the deletion that change was supposed to have removed.

    Excluding is also what CAUSES the rewrite, which is why no guard upstream
    fixes this. ``normalize_variable_tokens`` stops resolving an excluded
    variable's token, so the stored value reverts from the display name a
    previous scan wrote (``${locale}``) to the raw path the planner emits
    (``${payload.locale}``). Suppressing that rewrite would still not be enough:
    this arm keys on ``(event, field)`` and never on the variable, so any other
    reason the field's value changes — a new JSON path appearing beside the old
    one — takes the excluded row with it just the same.
