"""One event per scan identity: the three steps every scan writer shares.

``uq_event_scan_identity`` (``models/event.py``) forbids two rows under one
event type holding one ``source_name``. Both the scan (``generate_events``) and
the group-rule pass (``merge_existing_events_for_group_rules``) load a type's
rows into a map keyed by identity, adopt an identity for rows that have none,
and insert rows claiming a new one — and each of those steps can produce the
exact collision the constraint forbids. They are written once here so the two
callers cannot drift apart on what "this identity is taken" means (tripl-8tdl).

Not claimed: the adoption UPDATE itself is not raced. It is flushed outside the
savepoint below, so a writer that claims a NULL row's name between the load and
that flush still fails the run. The window is the same TOCTOU the API's
pre-check has, and it closes by itself on the next run — the writer's row then
holds the identity, is filed in the first pass, and the NULL row is left alone.

    NAME (authored through the API under a type with no name format, or seeded

    that name. Preference: the row traffic most recently landed on, then the

    Two passes, and the split is the safety. Every row that already carries a
    ``source_name`` is filed first (``setdefault`` — the constraint makes a
    second holder impossible, but if one is ever loaded anyway the first in
    winner order stays). Only then do the NULL rows, in the order given, each
    adopt their own ``name`` as the identity — and only if no row already holds
    it. A NULL row whose name is taken stays NULL, is absent from the map, and
    is not touched by the run.

    Adoption is an UPDATE of ``source_name`` on the next flush, so it is bound
    by ``uq_event_scan_identity`` like any insert. Adopting unconditionally, as
    both callers did before the constraint, would write the two collisions the
    constraint forbids: two NULL rows sharing a name, and a NULL row named like
    an identity another row already holds. An established identity beats a lazy
    adoption because the established row is the one every previous scan has
    been routing to; letting a NULL row take the name would move that history.
