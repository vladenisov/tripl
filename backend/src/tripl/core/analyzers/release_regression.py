"""Release-regression detection for app-version metrics.

Pure functions implementing the release-regression model. The decision note that
first specified it was deleted as stale, so the four points below ARE the model
rather than a summary of one — keep them in step with the code:

1. Maturity gate on share of TOTAL traffic — a release is "active" only once it
   takes real user traffic, which excludes the dev/tester build phase. A build
   labelled as a prerelease is excluded outright, as subject and as baseline,
   because a share gate alone cannot see a TestFlight build that took real
   traffic.
2. Activation-anchored comparison window over the rollout overlap.
3. Composition-share normalization (expected vs observed counts) so adoption
   skew between a young and a mature release is removed.
4. ``missing`` vs ``volume_drop`` classification on deficits only.

No database or warehouse access here so the model stays unit-testable; the
recalculation layer loads the inputs from ``EventMetricBreakdown`` and persists
the results.

# Comparability gate (tripl-9y4l). Two releases are only comparable once they
# are drawn from a similar population. In the first hours of a rollout they are
# not: everyone on the new build is a fresh install working through onboarding,
# while the baseline is the steady-state base. Measured on windy-ios 15.7.4,
# seven hours in at 15.9% of traffic: 66.0% of its pageviews were
# onboarding/* + purchase/about_trial against 3.8% for 15.7.3. Under
# composition-share normalization that mechanically halves every steady-state
# screen, and it fired nine "regression" alerts against a healthy app.
#
# The statistic below is deliberately NOT a distribution distance. A real
# regression also moves the mix — if a release stops emitting `main`, the mix
# shifts by main's entire share — so a distance gate would suppress exactly the
# alert this analyzer exists to raise. What separates the two cases is where the
# new mass sits: a regression DESTROYS volume, and every survivor then
# renormalizes upward by the SAME factor 1/(1 - lost); a population change
# CREATES volume in scopes the baseline barely visited.
#
# Turning that into a number is where the first attempt went wrong, so the two
# properties it has to have are worth stating. It must key on scopes that are
# material in the NEW release, not on scopes that were minor in the baseline:
# "minor before" depends on how finely the catalog happens to be partitioned,
# and measurably so — merging the incident's eight onboarding screens into four
# moved the statistic from 0.63 to 0.00. And it must subtract the common
# renormalization rather than sum it: a loss of fraction L lifts every survivor
# by 1/(1-L), so summing those lifts over a long tail scores a genuine outage
# instead of a population change (a catalog with half its mass in sub-1% scopes
# scored 0.50 on `main` going silent, i.e. the bigger the outage the more
# certain the suppression).
#
# The floor on which scopes participate has to be an absolute COUNT, not a
# share of the release. A share floor is a statement about catalog granularity,
# not about evidence: calibrated on the 92-event pageviews scan it worked, and
# on the 2488-event catalog behind "Snowplow Events (iOS)" no single event ever
# reaches 1% of a release, so the gate scored 0.0000 on the very same population
# change it scores 0.4667 on. Poisson noise depends on how many times a scope
# was seen, so that is what the floor measures.
#
# Hence: over scopes seen at least ``min_scope_volume`` times in the new
# release, ``max(0, share_new - growth_slack * share_prev)``. A scope only
# counts once it has outgrown its baseline share by more than the slack, which
# absorbs any renormalization up to a 1 - 1/slack volume loss.

    ``results`` empty with ``comparable=False`` is a suppressed comparison, not
    a clean bill of health, and the two must stay distinguishable: silently
    returning no rows would leave an operator unable to tell "this release is
    fine" from "this release cannot be judged yet".

    A suppressed comparison still carries any ``missing`` rows. Composition
    normalization is what an incomparable population breaks, and that only ever
    manufactures partial deficits — every row in the windy-ios false alarm was a
    ``volume_drop``. An event that went completely silent is not something a
    different mix of users explains, and it is the one finding expensive enough
    that a false positive beats a false negative.

    ``comparable`` and ``reason`` carry no defaults on purpose. They used to
    default to ``True``/comparable, and the two paths that return before any
    comparison happens — fewer than two released active versions, and a baseline
    with no volume in the shared window — inherited that default and reported a
    clean bill of health for a comparison that was never made.
