    """One row per outage: the bucket where the scope stopped behaving normally.

    A scope that has gone silent stays silent, and every silent bucket scores the
    same way forever, so the per-bucket path re-announces one incident once per
    bucket per scan. Measured at production geometry (hourly, sigma 4.0,
    min_expected_count 50, 504 buckets of history, 30-bucket re-evaluation
    window, 2 settling buckets) one dead event produced 28 rows at 48h of death,
    0 at 72-96h and 28 again at 120-168h, most at z=-20.00 — the exact z the 5%
    relative stddev floor pins a drop-to-zero at. The non-monotonicity is the
    trend-shift detector claiming the run only while the deseasonalized trend
    still clears ``min_expected_count`` and dropping the claim once it decays
    below (and, on a hard death, overshoots negative), so suppression that hangs
    off the live trend level switches itself off exactly as the outage ages.

    The anchor is the first ANOMALOUS bucket of each run of zeros, NOT the first
    zero. That distinction is the whole correctness of this function. Anchoring
    on the first zero is right only for a scope whose baseline never sits at
    zero; for anything nightly-quiet, business-hours or regionally-quiet the run
    begins at a NORMAL zero, which is never anomalous — so the filter would drop
    every anomalous bucket in the run and emit nothing at any scan age, and a
    whole class of events would die silently. That is strictly worse than the
    duplicate rows this replaces, and it is what the first version of this patch
    did.

    Anchoring on the first anomalous bucket also survives the fit: it does not
    ask whether the trend detector still claims the run, so a run is announced
    once no matter how the decomposition drifts as the outage ages. Because
    ``_replace_scope_anomalies`` only rewrites rows INSIDE the evaluation window,
    the announcement stays on record once its bucket scrolls out, and later scans
    re-derive the same anchor, find it outside their window, and write nothing.

    Runs are contiguous in the ANALYZED series, not on the clock: a bucket the
    scan never covered is absent from the list, and an unobserved bucket is not
    evidence the scope came back, so a collection gap cannot split one outage
    into two announcements. An outage older than the loaded history does lose
    sight of its own anchor and re-announces once — that history is 504 buckets
    on the hourly grid, so it takes a three-week outage.

    COUNT-shaped series only. A count of 0 is an unambiguous "emitted nothing";
    for a fractional series 0.0 is a value (a ratio that happens to be zero, and
    possibly not even its minimum), so "the same incident" needs another
    definition there.
