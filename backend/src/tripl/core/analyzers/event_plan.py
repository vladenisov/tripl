"""Plan the events a breakdown analysis WOULD produce, writing nothing.

This is the pure half of :mod:`tripl.core.analyzers.event_generator`. It was
extracted so a dry-run can answer "what would this scan create?" through the
*same* code that a real run uses. ``generate_events`` persists at eleven sites
and cannot be made not to with a ``dry_run`` flag; a savepoint-and-rollback was
rejected because it really executes ``session.delete(Event)`` and
``delete(EventMetric)`` (``_event_generator_merge``). Re-implementing name
formatting, grouping and cardinality collapse for the preview would be a second
copy of the rules — a bug class this repository has already shipped twice — so
the rules live here once and both callers read them.

The split is: everything from the breakdown rows up to and including the group
rules is here; everything that touches a ``Session`` stays in
``generate_events``. Two consequences worth naming:

* the two ``ensure_variable`` calls become :class:`VariableNeed` entries on the
  result, in first-seen order. Order is load-bearing — ``ensure_variable``
  creates a variable with the FIRST type it is asked for and registers it on the
  index — so this is an ordered, de-duplicated list and not the ``set`` an
  earlier sketch called for;
* ``normalize_variable_tokens`` is NOT applied here. It rewrites raw path tokens
  to a variable's display name and needs the session-built index; it also runs
  strictly after the event name is built, so nothing here depends on it.

The event name is built from columns that have a field definition, which is why
``field_ids`` is the input rather than the ``FieldDefinition`` objects: a caller
planning a *hypothetical* catalog (the dry-run) can mint ids for fields the run
would create, and a caller writing a real one passes the ids it already has.

    Placeholders come from ``event_name_format_columns`` — the one ``{key}``

    column, and the ``col.path`` keys below are assembled only from ``col_meta``
    entries, which every column enters through ``field_ids.get(col_name)``.
    So deleting the FieldDefinition for ``event`` kills ``{event.category}``
    exactly as it kills ``{action}`` (tripl-3mmh), and reserving ``event`` away
    from ``catalog_sync`` does the same thing by another route (tripl-lpin).

    The FULL key is included as well, because a dot does not make a name a

    ``params.screen`` and its FieldDefinition is stored under that name. A

    These are the keys a row may legitimately not carry. ``GROUP BY ALL`` over
    ``JSONAllPaths`` gives a row that omits the key a group of its own, and the
    key is then absent from that row's path list; seeding it empty makes an
    absent JSON path behave exactly like a NULL regular column instead of
    killing the whole scan on "references unknown keys" (tripl-0zpq.92).

    Deliberately narrow at the COLUMN level. A dotted key whose BASE column is
    missing from ``col_meta`` — its FieldDefinition was deleted, or the column
    was reserved away — or that is not JSON is not seeded and still raises: that
    failure is what tripl-3mmh and tripl-lpin exist for.

    Deliberately NOT narrowed at the PATH level, which is the question a reader
    asks next. Nothing here checks that ``col.path`` is a path the scan collects
    or that any row carried it, so a placeholder whose path the producer renamed
    away — or simply mistyped — seeds ``""`` and renders as an empty segment
    instead of raising. That is a considered trade, not an oversight:

    * a path absent from the whole window is indistinguishable from a path
      renamed away, and raising on it would stop all collection for a quiet
      window — the outage class of tripl-0zpq.92;
    * the obvious narrowing, "require the key to be in
      ``meta['json_passthrough_paths']``", is wrong twice over. In the planner
      that list is declared INTERSECT observed (see ``plan_column_meta``), so it
      excludes a path the row does carry but the scan does not KEEP — rendered
      as the ``${col.path}`` variable template, a supported configuration — and
      the seed would go back to aborting the run for it. And the replay rebuild
      in ``worker.tasks.metrics.generation`` fills the same key from the declared
      map alone, so the planner and the collector would disagree about which
      keys may be seeded, which is precisely how a row's volume becomes a shadow
      candidate (tripl-0zpq.90).

    The silence is what is fixed instead: ``plan_events`` reports every dotted
    placeholder that NO row of the analysis carried as a ``details`` line, so an
    operator sees "rendered as an empty segment" rather than nothing at all.

    Reads ``is_json`` with ``.get`` because the same helper runs against the
    planner's ``col_meta`` and against the replay rebuild in
    ``worker.tasks.metrics.generation``, which does not always set the key.

    supplying none, in which case every such variable is planned exactly as this
    function used to plan all of them — ``high``, zero observations, no values —
    which is still what the dry-run and any caller without a sampler want.

    Its SCOPE is not the scope of anything else here, which the code cannot show

    enumeration of what this group emitted, and the ``high`` kind below is the

    ``json_value_paths`` — so the paths whose values the breakdown row carries and
    the paths that become variables are complements, and the row can never hold a
    value for a path that needs one. Widening the query to close the gap is worse
    than useless: ``get_time_bucketed_counts`` groups by ALL selected columns, so
    every added path becomes a grouping key that multiplies the result grain, and

    EVERY column of the row, not only the ones that earned a FieldDefinition.
    That distinction is the whole point of sharing this: a group rule is keyed
    on a column by name, and the columns rules are usually keyed on — the event
    type column, and the rule columns themselves — are exactly the ones
    ``reserved_catalog_columns`` denies a FieldDefinition, so building this dict
    from ``col_meta`` made the metric collector match no rule the catalog pass
    had already matched. Grouped events then lost their volume to shadow
    candidates (tripl-0zpq.90).

    Keyed off index maps rather than a :class:`BreakdownAnalysis` so the sync
    worker, which never has one, calls the same code.

    EVERY declared path is written, including the ones this row does not carry —
    those come back from ``toJSONString`` as the literal string ``"null"`` and
    are kept as ``"null"``. Skipping them would make the collector's dict differ
    from the planner's, which is the divergence tripl-0zpq.90 is about, so the
    absent paths are cheap here rather than absent.

    Cost matters: the metric collector calls this once per row, three times per
    chunk, with ``metrics_row_limit`` (100k) rows per chunk and a replay-widened
    path map that reaches hundreds of entries. So the declared paths are walked
    ONCE per row — not once per JSON column over all of them — and the ``"null"``
    of an uncarried path short-circuits ``json.loads``. Splitting the path on its
    FIRST dot to find the column is the convention everywhere else
    (``group_json_value_paths``, ``name_format_base_columns``): a warehouse
    column whose own name contains a dot is not addressable by this pipeline.
