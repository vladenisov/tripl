"""Normalized classification of warehouse column types.

Each warehouse spells its types differently — and, critically, *cases* them
differently. ClickHouse reports ``JSON`` / ``Map(String, String)``, BigQuery
reports ``JSON`` / ``RECORD``, and psycopg reports PostgreSQL's ``json`` / ``jsonb``
in lowercase. A case-sensitive substring match for ``"JSON"`` therefore silently
classifies every PostgreSQL JSON column as a plain scalar, which is why JSON
preview, discovery and path extraction never activated on PostgreSQL at all.

Classification here is case-insensitive, so each dialect's spelling is matched
explicitly rather than by lucky substring.
