"""Which auto-detected variables nothing references any more.

A scan mints a :class:`~tripl.models.variable.Variable` for every placeholder it
discovers, and nothing has ever retired one. On a project whose warehouse holds
a JSON column keyed by user-typed text — a map, not a struct — that is unbounded
growth in the width of one column: production's ``windy-ios`` carried 1517
variables of which 1296 were referenced by nothing at all, 1279 of them minted
from the keys of a single ``property`` column (``property.Adana``,
``property.Albany, OR``, and two whitespace-only keys). tripl-10h4.

The obvious fix — stop minting above a cardinality threshold — was tried on
paper and rejected. Paths are discovered per COLUMN across the whole scan
window, but they are *stored* per EVENT, and per event the set is small and
load-bearing: ``session_end`` holds ``{"session_time": "${property.session_time}"}``
and ``screen_spot`` holds six named forecast fields. Those are the tracking
plan. A column-level gate cannot tell ``property.session_time`` from
``property.Adana`` — it would refuse both, and every later legitimate field on
that column would render as an unknown token forever.

So the discriminator is not shape, it is USE, evaluated after the fact:

    a variable is retirable when a scan created it, no human has touched it,
    and nothing in the project refers to it.

That splits the production data exactly — 1296 retirable against 221 kept, with
zero human-authored rows in the retirable set (measured, 2026-08-13).

**Both "no observed context" and "no stored ``${token}``" are required, and
neither implies the other.** tripl-xfxa is the standing proof: a group-rule
merge deleted the source event and let its ``VariableValue`` rows cascade away,
leaving eighteen production variables that a live event's field value still
names but that have no contexts at all. A predicate resting on contexts alone
would have deleted precisely those eighteen — the victims of the other bug in
this change. The token pass is what keeps them.

The module is pure on purpose: the danger-zone endpoint runs it on an
``AsyncSession`` and the scan worker runs it on a sync ``Session``, and a second
copy of this predicate is the defect class the rest of this package spends its
docstrings guarding against.

    put there by a person. The name is the newest of those arms and the one
    tripl-bwo8 made necessary: with the sweep running on every scheduled cycle
    rather than only under a declared lookback, a JSON key that stops arriving
    for one interval loses its ``${token}`` and its context in that run's
    rewrite and is a fossil by this predicate. Recycling the row is the point of
    the sweep — the next run mints the key afresh — but a re-mint runs
    ``derive_display_name`` again, so the operator's rename is gone and the key
    comes back as ``adana`` under a new id. Keeping a renamed row is what lets
    the sweep run unattended.

    The scan writes exactly one of ``source_name`` itself (every row minted
    before short names existed, and still the fallback when every short name
    is taken) or a ``display_name_candidates`` entry, so a name outside that
    set was typed by a person. The check is an
    approximation in one direction only: a rename that happens to land on a
    LONGER candidate (``adana`` renamed to ``user_adana``) reads as the scan's
    and is not detected. That false negative costs what it cost before this

    True when ``source_name`` is set, dotted, and ANY proper dotted prefix of
    it names a column in *json_columns* — the base column or a longer prefix,
    because a ClickHouse ``Nested`` column is itself returned as a dotted name
    and its FieldDefinition is stored that way. ``nested.col`` with no JSON
    column named ``nested`` is therefore scalar, and "contains a dot" is not a
    safe discriminator on its own (observed-values-2026-08-30). BigQuery is not
    the case that needs the longer prefixes — its adapter emits one column per
    top-level field, so a ``RECORD`` reaches this as the undotted ``payload``.

    The discriminator is the stored ``FieldDefinition.field_type`` rather than
    the shape of the bindings for two reasons. First, the shape lies: the scan
    writes ``bindings=[source_name]`` for a scalar column and a JSON path alike,
    and the only difference between ``payload.user.plan`` and a Nested column's
    ``nested.col`` is what the warehouse says the base column is — which the
    catalog sync recorded as the FieldDefinition's type when it created it
    (``generation._ensure_event_type_with_fields``). Second, the question this
    answers is about the REWRITE hazard, not about the token: a scalar column's
    stored value can flip from ``${token}`` to a literal on the cardinality of
    one window (``event_plan.plan_column_meta`` sets ``is_low`` only on the
    non-JSON branch), and a JSON column has no such arm. That hazard follows the
    column's type, not its spelling.

    A variable with hand-written bindings never reaches this check:
    ``_human_claim`` keeps it as ``USER_EDITED`` first, so a user binding
    ``variant`` to both a scalar column and a JSON path is never a sweep
    candidate and never has to be classified.
