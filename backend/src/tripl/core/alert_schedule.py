"""Wall-clock cron schedules for alert digest delivery.

An alert destination may hold its alerts back and deliver them on a cadence
instead of after every metrics collection. The cadence is a standard 5-field
cron expression (``minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week``) evaluated in
the owning project's IANA timezone; the UI's friendly presets ("daily at
09:00") are just cron strings the frontend generates, so there is exactly ONE
encoding of a cadence in the system and one implementation that reads it.

Parsing rides on :mod:`celery.schedules`' ``crontab_parser``, which is already
a runtime dependency and already understands every field form worth
supporting (``*/15``, ``9,17``, ``mon-fri``). What celery cannot do for us is
answer "when did this last fire", because ``celery_app.conf.timezone`` is
pinned to UTC and beat owns the only schedule it evaluates — so the walk over
fire instants lives here.

Two properties the rest of the system depends on:

* **Instants are compared in UTC, never in wall time.** Local wall clock is
  not monotonic: on the autumn DST fold a wall time occurs twice, so "is
  02:30 still in the future?" has no answer in local terms. Every candidate is
  converted to UTC and compared there. Getting this wrong silently skips one
  digest per year. The flip side is deliberate: a cadence whose hour falls
  inside the fold hour fires TWICE that day, because 02:30 CEST and 02:30 CET
  are an hour apart and each opens a window of its own. Nothing downstream
  collapses that pair — the flusher claims windows by UTC instant, so its
  compare-and-set rejects a repeat of the same instant and has no way to
  recognise, or any reason to reject, a repeated wall time.
* **A nonexistent local time folds FORWARD.** On the spring gap, ``02:30``
  simply does not happen, and :class:`zoneinfo.ZoneInfo` will answer for it
  two ways: ``fold=0`` resolves it to 03:30 local (an hour late) while
  ``fold=1`` resolves it to 01:30 local (an hour EARLY). Only the forward
  answer is kept, deliberately. A skipped digest is a silent 24h outage and
  firing an hour late is the strictly better failure — but firing an hour
  BEFORE the wall time an operator configured is not a better failure at
  all: it ships a digest while the window it claims to summarise is still
  open, and it does so at a time the schedule never named.

    Normally one. On the autumn fold a wall time is ambiguous and maps to two
    real instants an hour apart; BOTH are returned and both are fire instants,
    ordered by the caller in UTC because the wall clock is not monotonic there.
    A cadence inside the fold hour therefore gets two windows that day, and the
    flusher neither collapses them nor mistakes them for a double send: its
    compare-and-set is keyed on the instant, and the two differ. Collapsing the
    pair here is the tempting tidy-up and it is wrong — an hourly cadence has
    25 real fires on that local day, and keeping only ``fold=0`` drops one.

    On the spring gap it maps to NEITHER of ``fold``'s two answers, because it
    does not occur: ``fold`` stops choosing between two real readings of one
    instant and starts choosing which side of the jump to land on. ``fold=0``
    keeps the pre-transition offset and lands 02:30 on 03:30 local; ``fold=1``
    keeps the post-transition offset and lands it on 01:30 local, an hour
    BEFORE the configured time. Returning the pair there would hand the
    flusher two windows for a wall time that happened zero times, and the
    earlier of the two ships the digest ahead of its own schedule
    (tripl-0zpq.280) — so the gap keeps only the forward instant.

    time that exists always comes back as itself, and only a nonexistent one
