    Four implementations exist: ClickHouse, PostgreSQL and BigQuery emit SQL,
    while the in-memory synthetic adapter answers from Python lists. These
    docstrings are the entire specification an adapter author reads, so a wrong
    one here is a defect rather than a typo.

    Top-N breakdown folding (``values_limit``)
    ------------------------------------------
    Every method below that takes ``values_limit`` collapses the tail of a
    breakdown column into a single ``'Other'`` row, and all four
    implementations do it identically. The rule is stated here once on purpose:
    it used to be restated per method, and two of those copies disagreed about
    the ``- 1``.

    * ``values_limit is None`` keeps every distinct value and marks none of
      them as ``Other``.
    * Otherwise the top ``values_limit - 1`` values survive and everything else
      collapses into one ``'Other'`` row. The ``- 1`` is deliberate rather than
      an off-by-one: ``'Other'`` occupies one of the ``values_limit`` slots, so
      a caller asking for N series gets N-1 real values plus the rollup and
      never renders N+1 of them.
    * Values are ranked by ROW COUNT over the requested window, descending,
      with ties broken by the breakdown value itself ascending in code-point
      order. Row count stays the ranking key even on the aggregate methods:
      ranking by the aggregate was rejected because the multi-aggregate methods
      carry several specs with different filters in one scan, so there is no
      single number to rank by, and one shared rule keeps a count series and an
      aggregate series over the same column showing the same values.
    * The tie-break is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. The surviving set
      comes from a separate pre-query, and callers make one adapter call per
      chunk of the window (the chunk loops in ``worker/tasks/metrics/``), so
      that pre-query runs many times per collection. Ranked by count alone —
      the original shape — an engine may return either of two equally-counted
      values at the cutoff, so ranking the same window twice, as a retried
      chunk or a replay does, can keep a different set than the first pass did
      and silently reshape the stored series.
    * "The requested window" is the CALLER's whole collection window, not the
      chunk (tripl-0zpq.346). Ranked per chunk, a chunked collection kept
      ``{a,b,c,d}`` for its first week and ``{a,b,e,f}`` for its last, so one
      series stored real rows for ``c`` early and none late — its counts sat
      inside ``'Other'`` there with nothing recording the demotion. A chunk
      loop therefore runs inside :meth:`top_n_ranking_window`, which makes
      every top-N pre-query rank over the loop's whole window, once, and hand
      the same set to every chunk. Outside that context the pre-query ranks
      over the method's own ``time_from`` / ``time_to``, as before.
    * "The caller" is the METRIC (or scan config) whose series is being
      written, never a batch of them. The batched fact path shares one
      breakdown scan between metrics, but it keys that scan on each limited
      metric's own window and ranks over that window, so the set a metric keeps
      does not depend on which group-mates happen to lag, and it matches the
      per-metric collectors that stay as its conformance oracle.
    * The ranking pre-query is the one statement of a chunked collection that
      spans the whole window: chunking bounds the bucketed scans, not the
      ranking. That is the price of one consistent set per collection; it is a
      single ``GROUP BY`` over the breakdown column(s) — no bucketing, no
      aggregates — and runs once per distinct pre-query, not once per chunk.
    * ``_is_other`` / ``is_other`` is the integer 1 on the rollup row and 0
      elsewhere in all four implementations, not a boolean.

    Conditional aggregates (``AggregateSpec.filter_sql``)
    -----------------------------------------------------
    Every method below that takes ``specs`` returns one cell per spec per
    bucket, and the engines must agree on when that cell is NULL, because NULL
    is not a value on this path: ``_index_multi_aggregate``
    (``worker/tasks/metrics/metric_collect.py``) skips NULL cells, so a NULL
    leaves a GAP in the stored series rather than a zero.

    * A bucket with NO row matching ``filter_sql`` is that gap. This is what
      makes the batched path agree with the per-metric path, whose separately
      filtered scan returns no row at all for such a bucket.
    * A bucket that HAS matching rows is a data point, even when the aggregate
      over them computes to 0. The presence test is therefore a count of
      matching ROWS and never the aggregate's own value: ClickHouse
      ``countIf(cond)``, PostgreSQL ``count(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)``, BigQuery
      ``COUNTIF(cond)``, and, in the in-memory adapter, "did any row match".
    * ``count_distinct`` is why this has to be written down rather than left to
      each adapter. ``count(DISTINCT m)`` is 0 BOTH for a bucket nothing
      matched and for a bucket whose matching rows all have ``m IS NULL``, so
      an adapter that tests the aggregate for 0 — the shape PostgreSQL and
      BigQuery carried, against ClickHouse's row-count gate — reports the
      second as a gap on two engines and as 0 on the third. Plain ``count`` is
      the one aggregate whose filtered value IS the row-presence count, so
      testing it for 0 asks the same question and stays spelled that way.
    * Nothing here overrides what an aggregate returns over rows it DID match:
      ``sum`` / ``avg`` / ``min`` / ``max`` over matching rows whose measure is
      NULL throughout are whatever the aggregate itself computes, not something
      the presence gate decides. The three SQL adapters hand that answer back
      untouched — ``sum(m) FILTER (WHERE cond)``, ``SUM(CASE WHEN cond THEN m
      END)``, and ``sumIf`` under a sentinel that fires only when NOTHING
      matched — so on them the cell is that engine's own ``sum`` over an input
      holding no non-NULL value: NULL under standard SQL, and therefore a gap.
    * All four agree on that last case, the in-memory adapter included:
      ``synthetic._aggregate`` answers ``None`` for ``sum`` / ``avg`` / ``min``
      / ``max`` over a set with no non-NULL measure, and ``count_distinct``
      counts 0 on all four. It used to answer ``0.0`` for ``sum`` alone, so the
      demo warehouse stored a zero where the SQL engines leave a gap — reachable,
      because ``amount`` is in ``synthetic._EVENTS_NULLABLE`` and every
      screen-view row carries NULL in it (tripl-0zpq.345). Nothing pins the SQL
      side of the comparison by execution: the conformance fixture keeps all-NULL
      breakdown groups out by construction (``tests/conformance/dataset.py``).
    * A spec with no ``filter_sql`` is unconditional and none of this applies.

    Field contracts (``validate_field_contracts``)
    ----------------------------------------------
    ``validate_field_contracts`` below is the reference implementation, from
    sampled rows; the three SQL adapters override it and count in the
    warehouse. Whichever runs, three things are fixed.

    * ONE scan of the window per statement. Every expectation's aggregates ride
      side by side over a single ``FROM (base_query)``. A UNION ALL of one
      aggregate subquery per expectation — the shape PostgreSQL and ClickHouse
      both started with — is one statement but N scans of the same window, and
      the caller multiplies it: ``catalog_sync`` calls this once per event-type
      group, so N scans of the window become N x G reads of the same rows for a
      single collection. PostgreSQL and ClickHouse therefore hold at most
      ``FIELD_CONTRACT_EXPECTATIONS_PER_QUERY`` expectations per statement and
      issue another statement (another single scan) beyond that, rather than
      letting the target list grow with the contract count.
    * The warehouse COUNTS; the verdict is decided in Python. Each engine
      produces ``bad_count``, ``total_count`` and one ``sample_value`` per
      expectation and nothing else, and :func:`field_contract_verdict` turns
      those three numbers into a violation or into nothing. That rule —
      ``total_count > 0`` and ``bad_count > 0`` and ``bad_count / total_count``
      strictly greater than the threshold, the threshold clamped into
      ``[0, 1]`` — is stated once, there.
    * An expectation that cannot be compiled is INERT, never fatal. It
      contributes no columns to the statement, produces no violation, and — the
      half that was not shared — does not take the expectations beside it, or
      the collection around them, down with it. Neither call site used to defend
      against a raise: ``schema_drift._detect_field_contract_violations`` called
      this bare, and ``catalog_sync`` calls that once per event-type group
      inside a loop, so a single stale contract ended every group after it too.
      That call is now wrapped (the failure is counted and reported, never
      swallowed silently), which makes the wrap the second line and this rule
      still the first: an adapter that raises where it could decline costs the
      event type every OTHER contract it declared.
      :func:`field_contract_is_inert` holds the cases every engine agrees on and
      all four implementations ask it rather than re-deriving them.

    A bound that is not a finite number is in that list because it is the one
    input the four engines could not have been made to agree on by rendering it
    more carefully. GoogleSQL has no literal for infinity or NaN at all, so
    ``< -inf`` is a parse error rather than a comparison; PostgreSQL's
    ``numeric`` takes ``'Infinity'`` but orders NaN ABOVE every number;
    ClickHouse has both literals and compares them as Python does; and the
    fallback is Python. Declaring the expectation inert is the only verdict all
    four can give. Rendering just the finite bound and dropping the other was
    rejected: it reads correctly for a ``-inf`` minimum, which does mean
    "unbounded below", and inverts the contract for a ``+inf`` one, where every
    row is below the bound and the honest reading is "everything is bad".

    What an engine can compile is NOT itself shared, and the known divergences
    are declared rather than accidental.

    The first is the regex dialect. A ``contract_regex`` is screened at save time
    by Python's ``re`` (``schemas/field_definition``) and then compiled by
    whichever engine holds the data: RE2 on ClickHouse and BigQuery, POSIX ARE on
    PostgreSQL, ``re`` again in the fallback. No two of those accept quite the
    same language — RE2 rejects the lookaround that ``re`` and ARE both accept,
    ARE rejects ``re``'s ``(?P<name>...)`` — so a pattern that saved cleanly can
    be one THIS engine refuses, and it used to refuse it from inside the contract
    statement, which took every other expectation riding in that statement, and
    the collection around it, down with it. :meth:`contract_regex_is_compilable`
    asks the engine itself, once per distinct pattern per adapter, BEFORE the
    pattern reaches a statement; a refusal makes that one expectation inert here,
    says so in the log, and records it (:meth:`_skip_field_contract`) so the run
    summary reports it as ``contract_expectations_skipped``. The divergence
    itself is not fixable and is not worth
    faking: see that method for why a portable-subset screen was rejected, and
    ``PostgresAdapter``'s class docstring for the cases where all three dialects
    compile a pattern and disagree about what it MEANS, which no probe can catch.

    The second is BigQuery's. It refuses enum/regex/range on a REPEATED
    (ARRAY) column because GoogleSQL cannot cast an ARRAY to a single STRING to
    compare; ClickHouse's ``toString`` and PostgreSQL's ``::text`` both render
    one, and neither adapter reads column types on this path at all. Forcing
    the three to agree would mean spending a catalog round-trip per contract
    scan on two engines in order to DELETE a check that works there — and the
    two that work already disagree about the text they check it against
    (``['a','b']`` against ``{a,b}``), so there is no shared answer to converge
    on. The failure MODE is shared instead, which is the part that was broken:
    BigQuery raised out of ``validate_field_contracts`` before any SQL existed,
    and now skips that one expectation, logs it, records it for the caller the
    same way, and runs the rest.
    ``required_null_violation`` stays legal on such a column everywhere — it is
    pure NULL logic and needs no rendering.

    The third is PostgreSQL's range comparison domain (tripl-0zpq.349). The
    fallback, ClickHouse and BigQuery parse the value into float64 and compare
    there; PostgreSQL compares in exact ``numeric``, because float8's input
    function raises 22003 on overflow AND underflow-to-zero and one such row
    would abort the statement every expectation shares. Exact and rounded
    comparison give different verdicts only near a bound or outside float64's
    range: ``'9007199254740993'`` against ``max_value=9007199254740992.0`` is BAD
    on PostgreSQL and in range elsewhere (both round to the same double), and
    ``'-1e-400'`` against ``min_value=0.0`` is BAD on PostgreSQL and in range in
    the fallback (``-0.0``). A numeric string longer than
    ``postgres._FINITE_NUMBER_RE`` admits (510 integer or 1275 fractional
    digits) is BAD on PostgreSQL alone as well. Closing it would mean casting
    ``numeric`` to float8, which is exactly the raise being avoided.

    Deciding in Python rather than in each dialect is what keeps the engines
    from disagreeing about a borderline rate: the comparison used to be written
    four times, once per dialect plus the fallback's own
    ``bad_rate <= expectation.threshold``, and each of the three SQL spellings
    had to defend its division against a zero denominator as well.

    BigQuery is the documented exception to the second rule and only to the
    second: it evaluates the identical expression warehouse-side, inside the
    same single pass, because its array-of-STRUCTs shape already carries one
    row per expectation and filtering there keeps a passing contract off the
    wire. That is only safe while the expression really is identical, which is
    why the threshold it interpolates has to round-trip the double exactly.

    For the three SQL engines ``limit`` bounds only how many violation rows come
    back, never what is evaluated — evaluating everything is the point of
    counting in the warehouse. The fallback is the exception it cannot help
    being: it counts the rows it sampled, so there ``limit`` bounds both.

        The gate every implementation puts in front of a ``regex_violation``
        expectation, so that a pattern this engine refuses is inert here instead
        of fatal to the whole scan — the third fixed rule in the field contract
        section of this class. Which patterns those are is the first of the
        declared divergences documented there.

        Asking the engine is the whole design. The alternative was a static
        screen for a "portable subset", either here or at the save boundary, and
        it is wrong in both directions: it would have to reject the lookahead a
        PostgreSQL-only project is entitled to use, and it would still be
        guessing at the grammar of a library that can simply be asked.

        Answers are memoized per adapter, so the cost is one tiny statement per
        DISTINCT pattern per task no matter how many event-type groups
        ``catalog_sync`` runs, and nothing at all for a config with no regex
        contract. A refusal is NOT retried within the run; a probe that could not
        RUN is not cached at all, because the next call may be past whatever was
        wrong with the connection.

        The two failure modes are told apart by asking the same question about a
        pattern that cannot be the problem, rather than by reading driver
        exception types — each engine spells those differently, and a taxonomy
        written here would be three claims about three libraries that only a live
        warehouse could check. If the control pattern compiles, the engine is
        answering questions and its refusal was about the pattern. If it does
        not, we learned nothing, and the honest answer is to leave the contract
        in the scan: the real statement will fail moments later and the caller
        contains that (``worker/tasks/metrics/schema_drift``), which is a far
        better outcome than silently retiring a working contract because a

        Mirrors get_time_bucketed_breakdown_counts but emits ``agg_fn`` over

        tail into an ``'Other'`` bucket under the top-N contract on
        :class:`BaseAdapter`, exactly like the count path.

        The breakdown column is grouped by its FOLDED value ONLY. It also
        occupies its own slot in the regular-column block — ClickHouse,
        PostgreSQL and BigQuery all reject a ``breakdown_column`` that is not
        also in ``regular_columns``, and the in-memory adapter accepts either —
        and that slot repeats the folded value rather than the raw one. Grouping
        by the raw column as well would give one ``'Other'`` row per raw value
        that fell into it, which is the one thing the rollup exists to prevent,
        and would likewise split a nullable column's NULL and ``''`` rows even
        though both render to ``''``. The sibling
        get_time_bucketed_multi_aggregate_breakdown never had the problem
        because it carries no regular columns at all.

        This is therefore the ONE place the "mirrors the count path" sentence
        above stops holding: get_time_bucketed_breakdown_counts(_multi) still
        groups every regular column raw, breakdown included, in all four
        implementations. That is a different situation rather than the same
        defect left unfixed — the count path's consumer in
        ``worker/tasks/metrics/`` re-aggregates its rows in Python under a key
        that never carries the raw value, so a fan-out there costs rows fetched
        and nothing else, while THIS method's rows go straight into an upsert
        whose conflict target is the folded key.

        Repeating the folded value was chosen over dropping the breakdown
        column from the projection: dropping it would shorten every row and
        shift the JSON blocks left, and callers read this layout positionally.
