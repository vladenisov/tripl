"""Local, in-memory synthetic warehouse adapter (epic tripl-2su6.3).

The synthetic adapter replaces the never-queried fake ClickHouse source that
generated demo projects used to carry. It exercises the *normal* warehouse-facing
code paths (preview, schema introspection, time-bucketed counts / breakdowns /
aggregates, sql-metric collection) against a bounded, deterministic dataset that
is generated entirely in memory — it NEVER opens a socket or touches the
filesystem.

Design
------
* Two tables, ``events`` and ``orders``, with fixed schemas matching the demo
  scenario. Rows are generated deterministically from a fixed seed via SHA-256
  (never the salted builtin ``hash()``), and every digest is keyed on ABSOLUTE
  time (the UTC epoch hour / date ordinal of the row's bucket), so the same seed
  yields the same rows for the same instant NO MATTER WHICH ANCHOR generated
  them. That is stronger than "same seed and anchor are byte-for-byte identical"
  and it has to be: ``registry._build_synthetic`` rebuilds the adapter on every
  scan with ``anchor=None``, i.e. with a MOVING anchor, so anchor-relative keys
  made the same absolute hour hold different rows on every scan (bd
  tripl-0zpq.73). The total row count is capped.
* The most-recent ``SYNTHETIC_ONGOING_HOURS`` hours are generated at each event's
  seeded *base* volume (a believable daily/weekly shape with mild noise), so a
  live scan's current window continues the demo's seeded baseline instead of
  reading a near-empty warehouse and stamping a spurious drop (bd tripl-yfsj.14).
  Older hours stay at a small "sample" scale so the 30-day dataset (preview,
  active-sessions history) stays comfortably within the row budget.
* Every abstract method aggregates the in-memory rows in Python according to the
  STRUCTURED params it receives (time window, regular/breakdown columns,
  aggregation + measure, ``AggregateSpec`` list, top-N ``values_limit``). It does
  not parse SQL beyond three things: which table ``base_query`` selects (a query
  that mentions ``orders`` reads the orders table, otherwise the events table),
  which columns it projects (a bare ``SELECT a, b, c FROM ...`` list narrows the
  columns the caller sees; anything else means "every column"), and its top-level
  ``WHERE`` predicate, which is evaluated row by row. The predicate matters
  because the per-metric fact collector delivers a row filter by WRAPPING the
  source — ``SELECT * FROM (<source>) AS _filtered WHERE <combined>`` — so an
  adapter that ignored it answered the UNFILTERED question and disagreed with the
  batched path, whose filter arrives as ``AggregateSpec.filter_sql``.
* Filter fragments are read in the dialect this source DECLARES.
  ``measure_validator._DB_TYPE_DIALECT`` maps ``"synthetic"`` to ClickHouse, so
  everything the collector compiles for it arrives back-tick quoted and
  backslash escaped; the evaluator accepts that spelling (and PostgreSQL's, since
  named / free-text filters are user text) instead of silently matching nothing.
* The sql-metric path funnels through ``get_preview_rows`` with the metric SQL as
  ``base_query``. The seeded aggregate statements (distinct sessions per day) are
  recognized by EXACT match and computed from the dataset; a plain table scan
  returns rows; any other SQL raises :class:`SyntheticCapabilityError` rather than
  fabricating data.
* Read-only only. Row/time limits are honored and the dataset is held to a
  row-count budget at construction. ``test_connection`` is an honest LOCAL check
  (the dataset is present) — it never claims a real warehouse connection.
