        DATE a ``datetime.date``. ``_query_rows`` passes cells through verbatim, so
        without this the type of ``_bucket`` depended on the declared type of a column
        the caller never sees. The consumers assume one type: they compare the bucket
        against a window bound that is aware by construction
        (``floor_to_bucket(datetime.now(UTC), ...)``) and persist it into
        ``DateTime(timezone=True)`` columns. Two of the three families are a

        ``metric_rows``) were not, which is how the bug survived that fix.

        Unconditional rather than skipped for a declared-TIMESTAMP column: ``to_utc``
        on an already-aware datetime returns an equal value, and making the rewrite

        those are an "Unclosed string literal". Both facts were verified against
        ZetaSQL for the sibling helper ``measure_validator.quote_sql_string_literal``,
        whose docstring records the verdicts; this method had only the first half, so
        any value carrying a newline produced a literal that spanned lines and failed
        the statement outright.

        That is a correctness and availability bug rather than an injection one: a
        value can only ever add PAIRED quotes, never an odd one. What it costs is the
        run. Several callers hand this an already-validated identifier, but several do
        not: a breakdown's top-N values, a grouped event-type value and a discovered
        JSON path are warehouse DATA, and an enum option and a contract regex are
        analyst text that ``schemas.field_definition`` bounds only by length and
        compilability — neither of which excludes a line terminator. Nothing sanitises
        any of those on the way to a literal, so one row carrying a newline fails the
        chunk for as long as that value stays in the top N, which for a high-volume
        value is indefinitely.

        Escaping order is load-bearing: the backslash is doubled FIRST, so a value
        ending in a backslash cannot escape the closing quote, and an input containing
        the two characters ``\\n`` is not confused with a real newline.

        Deliberately NOT delegating to ``quote_sql_string_literal``. That helper serves
        the visual condition builder, where its input is one analyst-typed filter
        value: it ``strip()``s and rejects the empty string and NUL. Both are wrong
        here. A breakdown value's leading/trailing whitespace is part of the group key,
        so stripping would merge ``"a"`` and ``"a "`` into one group and misattribute
        their counts; and the empty string is the legitimate NULL-collapsed group value

        fallback in ``BaseAdapter``. What counts as a VIOLATION is not decided here at
        all — see the field contract section of ``BaseAdapter`` for where that lives and
        why this method is the one place still allowed to apply it warehouse-side:

        * **required_null_violation** — the NULL *is* the violation, so NULLs are counted
          in the denominator: ``total`` is ``COUNT(*)``, not the non-NULL count. Its sample
          is the literal ``'<NULL>'``, exactly as the fallback records it.
        * **enum / regex / range** — a NULL carries no evidence either way, so it is
          EXCLUDED from the denominator entirely (``COUNTIF(col IS NOT NULL)``), matching
          the fallback's ``if raw_value is None: continue`` *before* it increments
          ``total_count``. Getting this backwards would dilute every bad_rate by the null
          rate and quietly push violations under their threshold.
        * **regex** — GoogleSQL's ``REGEXP_CONTAINS`` is a PARTIAL match (verified against
          ZetaSQL: ``REGEXP_CONTAINS('xu1x', 'u\\\\d')`` is TRUE), which is what
          ClickHouse's ``match()`` and the fallback's ``regex.search()`` both are.
          ``REGEXP_FULL_MATCH`` would be the anchored one and is deliberately NOT used.
        * **range** — a value that is not a number at all is BAD, not "skipped". The
          fallback treats a ``float()`` failure as a violation and ClickHouse counts
          ``isNull(toFloat64OrNull(...))`` as one, so ``SAFE_CAST(... AS FLOAT64) IS NULL``
          is a bad condition here too. Both warehouses cast from the column's STRING
          rendering rather than its native type, so all three agree on what "malformed"
          means.

        The sample is ``MIN(IF(bad, value, NULL))`` rather than an ``ANY_VALUE``: MIN
        ignores NULL inputs, so it can only ever return a value from a row that actually
        violated, and it is deterministic, where ClickHouse's ``anyIf`` is not.

        "Inert" here is the shared list plus what THIS dialect declines — a REPEATED
        column, and a pattern RE2 will not compile — and that split is the whole
        point: what an expectation MEANS is shared, what an engine can compile is

        that first occurs at row 50,001, and the ``bad_rate`` it reports describes the
        sample, not the data — so a contract could be badly violated and the scan would
        either miss it or under-report it straight past its threshold.

        ONE job AND one scan covers every expectation. The shape both other SQL engines
        started with — a ``UNION ALL`` of one aggregate subquery per expectation — is one
        job but N SCANS of ``base_query``, and BigQuery bills by bytes scanned, so a table
        with ten contracts would be billed ten times over on every scan. Instead the
        per-expectation aggregates are computed side by side in a SINGLE pass, assembled
        into an array of STRUCTs, and unnested into the one-row-per-violation shape the
        caller wants. The threshold/nonzero filtering happens on the unnested rows, so a
        passing contract never crosses the wire; PostgreSQL and ClickHouse reach the same
        single pass but stop at the counts and decide in Python, which the field contract
        section of ``BaseAdapter`` states as the rule and this method as its exception.

        ``limit`` no longer bounds what is *evaluated* (that is the whole point); it stays

        With no ``filter_sql`` this reuses the exact single-aggregate fragment
        (``build_aggregate_sql``) so values match the per-metric path. With a
        filter, BigQuery lacks the ``FILTER (WHERE ...)`` clause, so the
        condition is folded into the aggregate per the dialect rules:
        ``count`` -> ``count(CASE WHEN cond THEN 1 END)``; ``count_distinct`` ->
        ``count(DISTINCT IF(cond, col, NULL))``; ``sum/avg/min/max`` ->
        ``agg(CASE WHEN cond THEN col END)``. ``filter_sql`` is a pre-validated
        boolean fragment injected as-is, matching the row-filter trust model.

        The NULL-means-gap rule this implements is stated once, on
        :class:`~tripl.core.adapters.base.BaseAdapter`: a bucket is absent for a
        spec when NO row in it matched ``cond``, and a bucket that does have
        matching rows is a data point even when the aggregate over them is 0.
        Each aggregate spells the row-presence test as cheaply as it can:

        * ``avg`` / ``sum`` / ``min`` / ``max`` over the ``CASE WHEN`` form need
          no test at all — they already return NULL over zero matching rows.
        * ``count`` uses ``NULLIF(count(CASE WHEN cond THEN 1 END), 0)``,
          because that value IS the count of matching rows: 0 and "nothing
          matched" are the same statement. Spelling it as the CASE below was
          rejected — it emits the same verdict from twice the text and a second
          copy of ``cond``.
        * ``count_distinct`` needs an explicit ``COUNTIF(cond)`` probe:
          ``count(DISTINCT IF(cond, m, NULL))`` returns 0 both for a bucket
          nothing matched AND for a bucket whose matching rows all have ``m IS
          NULL``, so its own value cannot answer the question. It used to be
          ``NULLIF(..., 0)`` too, which reported an all-NULL measure over real
          rows as a gap, while ClickHouse — gating on ``countIf(cond)``, a row
          count — kept the bucket and stored the 0.
